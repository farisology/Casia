The gorgeous green plants add liveliness to the home while remaining timeless and versatile. Wandering Jew plant varieties are certainly on top of the chart for being the most eye-catching indoor plants.
This article discusses several Wandering Jew plant varieties you need in your home and office.
Wandering Jew, or Tradescantia zebrina or Zebrina pendula, is a popular houseplant with long, trailing stems and bright leaves. Because of its resilience and ease of care, this plant is native to Central and South America and is now a preferred choice of gardeners and plant lovers worldwide.
Tradescantia zebrina is the most frequent kind of Wandering Jew plant. This plant has long, slender stems that may grow up to three feet long, as well as deep green leaves on top and purple or magenta on the underside. Tradescantia zebrina stems are coated in tiny, fuzzy hairs that give the plant a delicate, velvety touch.
The Tradescantia fluminensis, popularly known as the Small-leaf Spiderwort, is a South American Wandering Jew variation. The leaves on this plant are tiny, spherical, and have a bright, vibrant green hue. Tradescantia fluminensis has delicate and slender stems, making it a great choice for hanging baskets or terrariums.
The Purple Heart plant, often known as the Purple Queen, is a common Wandering Jew admired for its gorgeous purple leaves. This plant’s leaves are long and thin, with a deep purple hue that brightens in bright light. Tradescantia pallida have purple stems, making it an eye-catching addition to any collection.
The Tradescantia spathacea, also known as the Moses-in-the-Cradle or Boat Lily, is a rare type of Wandering Jew plant native to Mexico and Central America. This plant has long, wide leaves that are bright green on top and purplish-red on the underside. The leaves of Tradescantia spathacea are grouped in a rosette arrangement, giving the plant a characteristic look.
The Tradescantia sillamontana, often known as the White Velvet or Cobweb Spiderwort, is a Wandering Jew admired for its distinct beauty. This plant has long, slender stems coated with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a fuzzy, velvety touch. Tradescantia sillamontana leaves are tiny and spherical, having a vivid green hue.
This magnificent Wandering Jew plant with long, trailing stems and green and white variegated leaves. A white stripe along the middle and green edges distinguishes the leaves. This plant has little white flowers that contribute to its appeal.
This Wandering Jew plant species is appreciated for its gorgeous tri-color leaves, which include pink, green, and white. The leaves feature a distinct design, with pink and white stripes in the middle and green borders. This plant also has tiny, beautiful pink flowers.
It’s a newer hybrid variation of the Wandering Jew plant, which has recently grown in popularity. It has tiny, triangular leaves that are pink, green, and purple in hue. The leaves have a distinct texture and feel somewhat fuzzy when touched. This plant blooms with little white flowers.
All these Wandering Jew plant varieties offer a distinct look to your home and make the decor more lasting. Moreover, these low-maintenance plants are versatile and easily adjust in every house space.
All the unique Wandering Jew plant varieties require unique conditions to grow. Therefore, you’ll need to strategize where to place each plant in your home. Here are some tips on how to keep the texture of the plants alive and where to place them:
You may maintain these lovely plants in a hanging basket or on a shelf if they get enough light and are not exposed to excessive temperatures. As a result, these plants prefer a sunny area or a bright window in the living room, bedroom, or kitchen.
The wandering Jew plant is a versatile and elegant plant that comes in various colors and shapes. Whether you prefer the rich purple leaves of Tradescantia pallida or the distinct texture of Tradescantia sillamontana, there is a Wandering Jew plant for you. These plants are a fantastic choice for novice and professional gardeners because of their easy-care nature and striking beauty. So which Wandering Jew plant varieties are you buying?"
1,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Echeveria Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/echeveria-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Echeveria is a succulent plant in the Crassulaceae family and is a close relative of the jade plant. Echeveria plants  originated in the desert areas of Texas, Mexico, Central and South America. Many varieties are referred to by the common name “Hen and Chicks.” The plant got this nickname because baby plants (offsets or plantlets) grow in a cluster around the base of the “Mother” plant. Echeveria plants are very popular as outdoor plants because they are drought resistant, and some can survive temperatures below 40°F (4.4°C) for a short period of time. Indoors, an echeveria plant, when placed in very bright light, rewards you with jewel- colored leaves and, in the spring and summer, clusters of flowers.  This is an easy-care plant if you have a bright spot in your home and are careful not to over water.
The plump, succulent leaves of an echeveria grow in a rosette and are usually pointed with smooth edges, though there are some varieties with a different leaf shape. A powdery wax called farina covers the leaves and protects them from getting burned when the plant is placed in direct sun. The most common echeveria plants have grayish-green or bluish-gray leaves. When placed in very bright light, the 1″-3″ long leaves can turn purple, dark purple, lavender, maroon, white with red edges, green with red edges, or pinkish lavender with pink edges. The flowers of an echeveria plant are usually red, yellow, peach, or orange and grow atop a tall stem. They usually last about two weeks. Intense light and proper temperature help an echeveria flower.
There are many different echeveria varieties. Here are a few of my favorites.
E. Agavoides “Lipstick” has green, pointed leaves with a red border -E. Agavoides “Ebony” has purple tipped leaves that are a bit wider and produces red,  lantern-shaped flowers with yellow edges.
E. Painted Lady has spoon- shaped, triangular, bluish gray leaves with a red border and produces yellow flowers with red tips
E. Afterglow has a large rosette of lavender-pink leaves with bright pink coloring around the edges and produces orange-red flowers in the summer.
E. Setosa (Firecracker Plant) has red tipped, pointed leaves covered in white hairs and produces clusters of red, urn-shaped flowers with yellow tips
E. Gibbiflora “Metallica” (Metallic Echeveria) is taller (2ft) and has larger leaves (4″- 6″). The plant has metallic bronze-green leaves with pink edges and produces red bell- shaped flowers.
E. Coloratura has rosettes of blue green leaves with pink edges and produces yellow flowers in the spring.
E. Elegans (“Mexican Snowball”) has pale green, rounded, spoon-shaped leaves and produces tall stalks of pinkish red, lantern shaped flowers with yellow tips in late winter and early spring
Be careful not to overwater
Some sunshine is necessary for flowering
Temperature should be 10°-15° cooler at night-this helps the plant to flower
In winter, reduce watering to once every month or two

 
 
How much light for an echeveria: An echeveria plant likes very bright indirect light and some direct morning sun.
 
 
How to water an echeveria: In the spring and summer, keep the soil of an echeveria plant barely moist, always erring on the dry side. Starting in late fall and throughout the winter, allow the soil to totally dry out before watering. The leaves become soft and even wrinkle a bit when the plant needs water. Water the soil and avoid getting water on the plant itself. Over watering is the main reason an echeveria plant dies.
 
 
How to fertilize an echeveria: During spring, summer, and early fall, feed every 2 weeks with a liquid fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus and potassium (2-7-7). Always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never feed an echeveria in late fall or during the winter. You can also use a cactus plant food.
 
 
Best temperature for an echeveria: Provide warm temperatures between 65°-80°F (18-27°C). The temperature should be 10°-15° cooler at night. During the winter, when the plant is resting, the temperature should be 10° cooler. An echeveria is not a cold hardy plant. If you put the plant outside for the summer, be sure to bring it indoors before the temperatures drops below 50°F (10°C).
 
 
Does an echeveria need high humidity: Succulent plants like an echeveria originated in warm, dry, desert areas and do well in low humidity.
 
 
Does an echeveria plant flower: Clusters of red, yellow, and orange flowers develop atop long stemsi during late spring, summer, and early fall.
 
 
Echeveria plant pests: Aphids, scale, and mealybugs can be a problem. See a picture and learn how to identify and treat these pest problems in the Glossary of the website.
 
 
Echeveria plant diseases: Over watering causes root rot and the plant quickly dies.
 
 
Best soil for an echeveria plant: A cactus soil is a good choice. You can also use regular potting soil but, if you do, add an equal amount of horticultural sand so that the soil is loose and drains quickly.
 
 
Best size pot for an echeveria: These plants like to be a little root-bound in a small pot with drip holes in the bottom. The pot should be 1″ larger than the root ball of the plant. Keeping en echeveria in a small pot allows the soil to dry out quickly and helps prevent over watering.
 
 
How to prune an echeveria: These plants need very little pruning. Gently remove any leaf that turns brown.
 
 
How to propagate an echeveria: Use leaf cuttings to propagate an echeveria. Gently detach a few leaves from the plant or use healthy leaves that have been knocked off. Place the leaves on a tray in indirect bright light. After 2-3 weeks a tiny plantlet with its own roots develops at the tip of the leaves. Plant the plantlet and its roots in a very small pot of cactus soil. Do not water, just mist the every few days until it roots well. You can also propagate an echeveria using offsets. (Read more about propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.)
 
 
Although an echeveria is a non-poisonous plant and safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children, the sharp tips of the plant leaves can cause a painful sore.

The leaves of an African Violet plant crack and become brittle when the plant is getting too much plant food. When fertilizing an African Violet plant always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength and only feed the plant is actively growing. Keep the leaves of African Violet plant dry and out of direct sun; and use plain non-chlorinated water for better leaf growth."
2,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Staghorn Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/staghorn-fern-how-to-grow-care-guide-2/,,,"A staghorn fern, also called an elkhorn fern, is native to the rain forests of Queensland Australia where it’s found growing on rocks and on the sides of trees. Staghorn ferns are unique looking plants and do not resemble any other fern plants. The large, spectacular, thick, outer leaves (“antler fronds”) grow out of the center of the plant and are shaped like elk or moose antlers. These leaves are covered in fine hairs that make them feel a little furry and give a staghorn fern a gray or silver look. The other very different looking leaf at the bottom of a staghorn fern is a brown, cup-shaped leaf (shield frond) that in nature captures nutrients that the plant needs. Outdoors, this frond also helps a staghorn fern cling to rocks and trees. Indoors this cup shaped frond helps a staghorn fern cling to the sides of the container in which it’s planted. Although a staghorn fern can be grown in a pot like any other houseplant, it looks best when mounted on a hard surface like a decorative board and hung on the wall. The bottom frond helps a staghorn fern cling to the decorative board.
Although there are many different species of staghorn ferns, the most popular one used as a houseplant is the Platycerium bifurcatum variety. A staghorn fern is not a good plant for someone who wants a forgiving,  green friend that can put up with being ignored or not cared for properly. This plant must be in an area that gets bright, indirect light and you can substitute artificial light. How you water your staghorn fern is very important because over and under watering are the main reasons a staghorn fern dies. Since staghorn ferns are often mounted on boards, the usual ways of watering potted plants won’t work. You’ll need to soak the fern in a sink of water for 10-20 minutes or mist all parts of the plant (undersides of the fronds especially). Follow the care tips below and you will have a staghorn fern, when mounted, looks like a piece of art.
A Staghorn fern grows best in bright, indirect light but no direct sun.
How you water a staghorn fern determines if the plant lives or dies! Check the center of a Staghorn Fern for moisture. When the top 50% of the soil at the center is dry, submerge the entire plant, pot, piece of bark, or basket in a sink of lukewarm water for 10-20 minutes. Green fronds fall off a staghorn fern from over-watering. Keep the soil dryer during the winter. You can also thoroughly mist ALL parts of the plant with a fine spray if you don’t want to try the soaking method.
Feed a staghorn fern monthly in spring and summer with a balanced fertilizer diluted to1/2 the recommended strength.
Temperature for a staghorn fern should be 65°-80°F (18.3°-26.7°C)
Staghorn ferns need plenty of humidity. Place a humidifier next to the plant if the air is too dry and the staghorn fern is not doing well.
Mealy bugs and scale can be a problem for a staghorn fern. Read how to identify and treat mealybugs and scale in the glossary of the website.
The high humidity a staghorn fern needs to thrive attracts a plant disease called powdery mildew. Read how to identify and treat powdery mildew in the glossary of the website.
Orchid bark mixed with potting soil makes a good soil for a staghorn fern. These ferns can also be grown in sphagnum moss that is attached to a piece of wood or bark. The arrangement can then be hung on a wall.
Clay pots of soil and wire baskets filled with sphagnum moss are good ways to plant a staghorn fern. These plants look wonderful mounted to a wooden plank and hanging on the wall. Take your staghorn fern out of its container and cover the entire root ball with moist sphagnum moss. Use plastic covered wire to attach the plant and moss to the plank or board you want to use as a wall hanger.
A staghorn fern is propagated using the plantlets or offsets that develop at the base of the plant. Trying to propagate a staghorn fern by plant division will damage the roots. Read more about how to propagate a plant using offsets in the Glossary of the website.
A Staghorn Fern is non-poisonous plant and is not toxic to cats, dogs, or humans.
I recommend inexpensive clay pots for a Staghorn Fern so you can easily break the pot and free the bottom fronds that are clinging to it when its time to repot and not damage the fern.
Yes chemicals in the water can definitely damage the fronds of ferns and many other houseplants. Staghorn Ferns are especially sensitive to manganese, which causes discoloration of the older foliage. Also, never use water that has passed through a softener. It is too salty.
Spots on leaves of Staghorn Ferns can be caused by several types of fungal infections, from blight and leaf-spot to mold or mildew. These infections are the result of over-watering or letting water splash on the fronds. You can generally control nearly any type of leaf-spotting problem by removing the affected leaves, providing the plant with better air circulation, and making sure that the area where you’re keeping the plant is not too humid."
3,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Persian Shield Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/persian-shield-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Persian Shield plant, sometimes called a Royal Purple plant, is a tropical, fast growing plant that loves high humidity and warm temperatures. It has dark green, iridescent leaves with metallic, light purple stripes. Originally from Myanmar (Burma) not Persia, it gets the name Persian Shield because the leaves resemble little, feudal battle shields. The pale purple flowers of a Persian Shield plant can’t compare to the beautiful leaves. This plant can be planted outdoors, but does even better as a potted, indoor plant.
A Persian Shield plant needs bright indirect light to maintain the vibrant colors in its leaves; but no direct afternoon sun or the leaves may be damaged. The plant becomes thin and leggy when there is not enough light.
Keep the soil barely moist, water when the top few inches of soil are dry. Spotting on the leaves occurs if cold water splashes on them. Water less in the fall and winter when the plant is not actively growing.
Do not fertilize a Persian Shield plant during the fall and winter. In the spring and summer, when the plant is actively growing, feed every two weeks with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
These plants like to be warm. Place them in an area where the temperature is always above 60°F (15.6°C).
Persian Shield plants require high humidity. Leaves dry up and fall off in low humidity. You can mist the leaves to increase the humidity, but use rain water or distilled water. Misting the plant with water containing chemicals such as chlorine or water that has passed through a softener puts marks on the leaves. If the air in your home is very dry, I’d recommend placing your Persian Shield plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
A Persian Shield plant has beautiful leaves; the flowers, however, are rather inconsequential. Put the plant outside for the summer to encourage flower spikes, but be sure to bring it indoors before the temperature drops below 60°F (15.6°C)
Aphids and whitefly: Learn how to identify and treat plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
This plant is fairly disease resistant. The main problem is root- rot from over watering.
A Persian Shield plant grows well in a rich soil that drains quickly.
Repot annually when the plant is young. As a Persian Shield plant matures, repot every other year. This is a fast growing plant. If it becomes too large and pruning is not controlling the size, try pruning the roots.
Aggressively prune a Persian Shield plant to keep it full and bushy
Use 2″-3″ stem tip cuttings to propagate a Persian Shield plant. Take the cuttings from the top of healthy stems just below a leaf node. Learn how to propagate using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
A Persian Shield plant is slightly poisonous with a #1 toxicity level.
Persian Shield plants require high humidity. When the humidity is too low, leaves dry uo and fall off.
A Persian Shield plant likes bright, indirect but not direct sun. Move your plant out of the direct sun and the leaves will start looking better."
4,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Purple Waffle Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/purple-waffle-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Purple Waffle plant, also called Metal Leaf plant, Waffle plant, Red Flame Ivy, and Red Ivy originated in the jungles of Java. The plant gets its name because of the”puckered” appearance of its leaves. A Purple Waffle plant, Hemigraphis alternata, only grows about 6”-8” tall but can produce stems 12” to 24” long and looks great in a hanging basket. This is a very pretty plant with shiny, dark green leaves that have a purple underside. Waffle plants are easy to care for and a perfect plant for beginners.
Provide medium to bright indirect light but no direct sun. The leaf edges turn brown and curl and the colors in the leaves bleach out if the light is too strong. When there is not enough light, the vibrant colors in the leaves of a Purple Waffle plant start to fade.
Keep the soil barely moist but not soggy, at all times. Water less during the winter when the plant is growing slowly.
Feed your Waffle plant monthly from late March through September with a plant food high in phosphate (5/10/5) diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Be sure the soil is moist when you feed the plant or the roots may get burned
Waffle plants likes warm temperatures between 55°F-75°F (12.8°C–23.9°C). Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) may damage the leaves.
These plants grow better and look better in high humidity. If the air in your home is very dry, set the plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. If you do mist the plant, mist during the warm part of the day so the leaves have a chance to dry before night.
A Purple Waffle plant occasionally produces small, tubular, white flowers.
Fairly pest resistant, but a Waffle plant may attract whiteflies and scale
Root rot develops when the plant is overwatered. Mildew may occur if you mist a Purple Waffle plant late in the day and the leaves don’t dry before evening.
Use a rich, organic soil full of peat moss that drains quickly.
Move the plant to the next size pot, and nothing larger, when the roots have filled the existing pot.
Pinch the stem tips of a Waffle plant to keep it bushy and compact. Allow some stems to grow long if you want to put the plant in a hanging basket.
Propagate during the spring and summer using 4″-6” stem tip cuttings taken just below a node in the stem.
This is an excellent clean air plant, made even better by the increased area of the deeply puckered leaves.
Non-poisonous to humans and pets"
5,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Philodendron Micans,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/philodendron-micans-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Philodendron Micans (Philodendron hederaceum var. Hederaceum), also called a Velvet Leaf Philodendron, is a member of the Araceae family of plants.  Like other plants in this group, such as the alocasia, caladium, and dieffenbachia, all parts of a Philodendron Micans contain calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides which makes it a poisonous plant. This very attractive, easy care plant  is native to Mexico and the Caribbean, and looks beautiful in a hanging basket or spreading out on a table. You can also train the plant to grow up a trellis or moss pole.
Although the leaf shape and growing pattern closely resembles that of the heart leaf philodendron, a Philodendron Micans does not have glossy, green leaves. This unique looking plant has velvety, heart-shaped, greenish bronze leaves with reddish- brown undersides. The leaves grow on long, graceful, vining stems. When young, a Philodendron Micans closely resembles the Philodendron Melanochrysum, but there are some major differences. A Philodendron Micans is a vining plant with draping stems while the Philodendron Melanochrysum is a climbing plant that grows upwards and needs a pole for support.  Although both plants have velvety, heart shaped leaves, the Melanochrysum, a much rarer plant, has creamy white veins.
Provide bright, indirect light, but avoid the direct sun
Be careful not to over water, but do not allow the soil to totally dry out. Water less in winter
Feed monthly during the warm months and every other month in cooler weather
These plants are not cold tolerant, avoid temperatures below 55°f (12.8°C).
Prune frequently to keep the plant full
Rotting stems – too much water, too little heat
Brown, dry leaves fall off – too much heat especially from being near a heater or fireplace in winter
Leaves are small and far apart on the stems – plant needs more light or more fertilizer
Fine, reddish webbing and pale leaves – Spider Mite problem
How much light for a philodendron micans: A philodendron micans prefers bright, indirect light, but no direct sun. Direct sun harms the beautiful, velvety leaves. This plant can survive in lower light but grows very slowly, the leaves tend to be much smallerl, and the plant becomes leggy as it stretches towards the light.
How to water a philodendron micans: Like many indoor houseplants, over watering a philodendron micans and not allowing the soil to dry out a bit, is the fastest way to kill the plant. Allow the top 1/3 of the soil to dry out before watering. When you do water, water well enough so that the water drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Never allow the plant sit in the excess water. During the winter, when the plant is resting, the soil needs to dry out even more. Always remember, the soil at the bottom of the plant container is wetter than the soil at the top.
How to fertilize a philodendron micans: Feed a philodendron monthly, in the spring and summer, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize every other month in the fall and winter. A philodendron micans is a fast growing plant; if the new leaves appear small or the plant is not growing well, it’s an indication that the plant needs to be fed more often.
Best temperature for a philodendron micans: A philodendron micans likes warm temperatures between 65°-75ºF (18.3°-23.9ºC) during the day and above 55º F (12.8ºC) at night.
Humidity for a philodendron micans: A philodendron micans grows in basic household humidity, but looks better and grows faster in higher humidity.
Does a philodendron micans flower: A philodendron micans does not flower when grown as an indoor houseplant.
Plant pests that attack a philodendron micans: Aphids, spider mites, mealybugs and scale are plants that can cause problems for a philodendron micans. Learn how to identify and treat these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
Philodendron micans plant diseases: Root-rot from over-watering is the main disease problem for a philodendron micans.
Best soil for a philodendron micans: Use a loose soil that is high in organic matter and drains quickly.
Proper pot size for a philodendron micans: Re-pot a philodendron micans when the roots of the plant have filed the existing container. Move the plant to the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can drain out. Be careful not to over water; since there is more soil, it will take longer for your philodendron micans to dry out.
How to prune a philodendron micans: Prune the long vines aggressively and frequently so the plant stays full and doesn’t become leggy. Do not use leaf shine products on a philodendron micans; they will ruin the velvety texture of the leaves.
How to propagate a philodendron micans: Propagate a philodendron micans using stem cuttings in the spring and early summer. Cuttings root very well in water. Read more about propagating plants using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Is a philodendron micans a clean air plant: A philodendron micans is a clean air plant that removes formaldehyde from the air. Formaldehyde is a harmful chemical found in insulation, floor coverings, cleaning agents, pressed wood, and even paper towels.
Is a philodendron micans a poisonous plant: All philodendron plants, including the philodendron micans, contain calcium oxalate crystals and are toxic to children, cats, dogs, and other pets."
6,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Ornamental Pepper Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/ornamental-pepper-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Ornamental Pepper plant (Capsicum Annuum) originally from South America, is an attractive plant that can be as small as 6” or, if planted outside, as large as 2-3 feet. They have upright, shiny, green leaves and when bearing fruit, these plants are covered in small, vibrantly orange, red, yellow, and purple peppers. An Ornamental Pepper plant grown indoors usually bears fruit only once and is then discarded or planted outside. This is an easy care plant that bears ornamental fruit in the fall and winter. If you are interested in learning about more easy care houseplants, check out our Plant Wizard.
Very bright light, even full sun. Ornamental pepper plants start to reach for the light and become quite leggy if they don’t get at least 6-8 hours of very bright light every day; near a south-facing window is a great location.
Keep the soil barely moist and water the surface of the soil evenly. Water well, until it comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot; then allow the top 20% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Do not allow the plant to sit in the excess water.
Feed every two weeks during the growing season with a liquid plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Use a plant food high in phosphorous and potassium (5-10-10); this ratio helps the flowers and fruit to develop. )ice the plant has developed fruit, stop fertilizing.
These plants like warm temperatures, above 75°F (23.9C) if possible. The warmer the temperature, the faster the plant grows and the fruits develop.
Basic household humidity
An Ornamental Pepper plant develops small white flowers before the fruit appears.
Aphids and spider mites can be a problem. Read more about how to identify and treat these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Leaf Spot and Wilt-diseases.
Use a rich organic soil that drains quickly. If the soil doesn’t drain well and stays wet too long, the plant develops root rot
Indoors, an Ornamental pepper plant rarely needs a pot larger than 6″. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom.
Pinching the top of the plant stems (just above a branching point) encourages the plant to branch out and become bushy and full.
Ornamental Pepper plants are propagated by seeds
Ornamental pepper plants are very popular around halloween and thanksgiving.
An Ornamental Pepper plant is a non-poisonous plant.
Sadly, ornamental pepper plants only bear fruit one time indoors, then most people just throw the plant out.
Ornamental pepper plants like to be really warm (above 75°F). It sounds like your home is just too chilly to grow an ornamental pepper plant."
7,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,False Aralia,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/false-aralia-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A False Aralia, native to New Caledonia, has many different names depending who you ask: Dizygothica elegantissima, Schefflera Elegantissima, or Spider Aralia. Whatever you call it, this is a beautiful plant with long, narrow, serrated leaves in a palmate (finger-like) arrangement. The color of the leaves starts out as a reddish, coppery green and gradually turns into a lovely dark green. A False Aralia can be used as a table plant when small and, when it matures, as a tall, exotic looking indoor tree.  It’s a great plant to propagate using stem tip cuttings.

A False Aralia likes bright indirect light, but no direct sun.
Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy. When you water, water well until the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Allow the top 1″-2″ of soil to dry out before watering again. Wilted leaves usually mean the plant is over-watered. The plant loses leaves if the soil is too wet or too dry. During the winter, when the plant is resting, allow the soil to dry out more before watering.
Feed every 2 weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a well- balanced liquid plant food. Feed monthly in the fall and winter. Always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength.
These plants like warm temperatures between 65°-85°F (18-29°C). If the temperature dips below 60°F (15.6°C) a false aralia may drop leaves.
Aralias require moderate to high humidity. If the air is too dry, a false aralia loses leaves.
Spider mites, scale, mealybugs, and aphids can all be aproble. Read more about these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
Plant disease problems are very rare.
Use a good quality potting soil that retains moisture but still drains quickly.
Aralias like to be a bit root- bound in small pots. Once the roots have filled the existing container, re-pot in the spring to the next size pot (nothing larger). Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape.
A False Aralia doesn’t need much pruning. It usually maintains a beautiful shape allow its own. If the plant drops leaves and gets thin, you can aggressively cut it back in the spring to make it bushier.
The best way to propagate an aralia is to use stem tip cuttings. Propagation should be done in the spring. If the stem on the aralia plant is very thick, air layering in another propagation method that works well with this plant. You can read all about various propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Aralias rest during the winter and require less water.
A False aralia is a non- poisonous houseplant.
There are several reasons why a false aralia loses leaves: The soil is too wet or the soil is too dry. The air is too dry. The temperature has dropped below 60°F (15.5°C)

It allows both heat and light to enter. Terraria (plural) can be open to the environment or sealed.
Use the open variety for succulent or semi- succulent plants (“dry plants”) that prefer dry air rather than high humidity. Some of the best plants for an open terrarium are air plants, echeveria, jade, kalanchoe, sedum, hawarthia, or small cacti.  Plants that require bright direct light also do better in an open terrarium. Avoid using plants with a large root system.
Closed terrariums are mini ecosystems that create a humid environment by retaining much of their moisture. In fact you may have to open a sealed terrarium and wipe down the sides if too much humidity builds up inside. Excellent plants for a closed terrarium are: pilea, nerve plants, baby’s tears, spider wort, aluminum plants, mini begonias, mini orchids, button ferns, and creeping fig. Avoid using tall climbing plants and plants with a large root system.
When creating a terrarium, be sure to use plants that have the same lighting, watering, humidity, and feeding requirements. It’s a recipe for failure to put a succulent plant that needs very bright light, dry soil, and low humidity in with a fern that thrives on moist soil, high humidity, and medium light. Find care requirements for specific plants in the Popular Houseplants section of the website.

The lighting for a terrarium depends upon the plants you decide to use. Succulent plants need very bright indirect light while other tropical plants will do well in medium light.
Watering also depends on the plants you select; succulent plants need very dry soil while ferns like a moist soil. Since terrariums are closed or semi closed containers it takes the soil longer to dry out so be careful not to over water.
Most terrariums need very little plant food since you don’t want the plants to get too large and outgrow their space. I recommend feeding twice a year with a fertilizer diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength.
Without your realizing it, the temperature in a terrarium can get too hot for plants. Keep your terrarium away from heaters and never in afternoon sun. Lift the lid to cool down the terrarium.
Lack of humidity is never a problem with a terrarium; on the other hand, too much humidity is often an issue. Open up the top of a terrarium container and wipe down the sides if condensation appears.
The high humidity encourages plants like mini orchids and begonias to bloom often.
Check frequently for plant pests. If a plant is heavily infected, it should be immediately removed. As a preventative measure, I spray monthly with a weak solution of insecticidal soap.
The high humidity inside a terrarium is very conducive to fungal and bacterial infections. Check the plants frequently and remove any dead leaves or infected plants immediately.
Proper drainage is essential or the roots of the plants stay too wet and the plant dies. First put in a 1/2 inch layer of pea gravel or aquarium grave. Next add 1/2 inch of horticultural gravel. You can add a layer of sphagnum moss is you want to prevent the next layer of soil from mixing into the charcoal and gravel. I tend not to because the moss often develops an unpleasant odor Then add about 2 inches (minimum) of a good potting soil rich in organic matter.
Aggressively prune thin, straggly plants. Remove dead plants and leaves as soon as they appear.
Use stem tip or leaf cuttings from plants that have grown too large to propagate new plants.
Terrariums make great gifts, but be sure to include care instructions.
Allow the soil to dry out before watering Succulent Plants in a terrarium. How often depends upon how much light and heat the terrarium gets?
The new pale leaves on your terrarium plants may me an indication that your terrarium needs more bright light. Try moving it to a brighter location and see if the problem improves.
It is very important to keep a terrarium clean and free of dead leaves and flowers. If a plant dies, immediately remove it and try to determine why it died."
9,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/1,Aralia Plant – Balfour,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/balfour-aralia-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Balfour Aralia plant is an evergreen plant native to Africa, Asia, Australia, parts of North and Central America, and South America. The distinct leaves of a Balfour Aralia resemble leathery, round, dinner plates about 1″- 2″ in diameter, which is how the plant got its nickname, the Dinner Plate Aralia.  The leaves can range in color from light green to dark green and some varieties have green and cream colored variegated leaves. Aralias are not  good houseplants for beginners since they are easy to over- water which results in root rot and leaves falling off.  These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
 
                 
Polyscisias Pinnata        Polyscias crispata
Balfour Aralia plants do best in bright indirect light; but will survive in low light if you are careful not to over-water.
Aralias have very fine roots and are easily over-watered. Always allow the top 1/2 of the soil in the pot to dry out before watering. During the winter when plants are resting, they need even less water. In low light situations, Aralias may need water only once a month.
Feed an Aralia plant every other month with a plant food high in nitrogen. Always dilute the fertilizer to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Balfour Aralias like basic household temperatures between 65-80 degrees.
High humidity helps Aralia plants grow better. Dry air, due to low humidity, is one of the reasons Aralias drop leaves.
Although Aralia plants don’t produce flowers indoors, they can be trained to be a lovely bonsai plant.
Aralia plants attract numerous houseplant pests such as mealybugs, scale, spider mites, and aphids. Spraying the plant with a biodegradable soap and water mixture on a regular basis helps prevent plant pest infestations.
Root-rot, caused by over-watering, is the main plant disease affecting Aralia plants.
Aralias need a peat-based, well-aerated, light soil. This type of quick draining potting medium prevents water from accumulating in the soil and causing the roots to disintegrate.
Keep Aralia plants in small pots so the soil dries out quickly.
Prune the tips of an Aralia to keep the plant full.
Aralia Plants are propagated by stem cuttings or, if the stems are thick enough, air layering. Propagating Aralias is more successful when temperatures are above 70°.
Aralia plants are poisonous houseplants with a level #2 toxicity. All parts contain saponins which cause gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Balfour Aralias like to be in small pots since that allows the fine roots to dry out quickly and not develop root rot. Re-pot an Aralia Plant only when the roots of the plant have filled the existing pot.
Aralia Plants are very sensitive to cold temperatures. If the temperature goes much below 60 degrees, an Aralia Plant will start dropping leaves."
10,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/2,Alocasia – Jewel Alocasia,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/alocasia-jewel-alocasia-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Alocasia “Jewel” plant, native to Asia, and is also called an Alocasia Nebula. Alocasia plants have large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges.  If you are searching for a dramatic, very different looking plant that can be as small as 6″ or as tall as a tree, an alocasia plant is a great choice. Alocasia plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed me to Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  These plants do require extra care and attention in order to stay looking good. Proper watering and high humidity help an Alocasia plant grow faster and not drop leaves.
An alocasia plant requires very bright indirect light. Direct sun burns the leaves.
Always allow the top 2″- 3″ of the soil to dry out before watering. Keep the soil evenly moist. Over- watering, wet leaves, and soggy soil makes an alocasia plant susceptible to a variety of serious fungal infections. Check the soil frequently until you are sure of the plant’s watering needs. Water less during the winter when it is dormant.
Fertilize every two weeks from late March through September with a balanced houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never fertilize an alocasia during the winter. Too much fertilizer causes salts to build up in the soil and burn the leaves.
Alocasia plants prefer warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C). Alocasia plants becomes dormant with prolonged exposure to temperatures below 60°F (15.6°C), and may drop all of their leaves. Be sure to keep an alocasia away from air conditioners and cold drafts. During warm summer months an alocasia plant can produce a new leaf every week and each new leaf may be twice the size of the previous leaf.
Alocasia plants grow best in high humidity. To increase the humidity around a houseplant, place the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. You can also increase the humidity by placing a small humidifier near the plant or grouping plants together.
An alocasia macrorrhiza produces a cream colored spathe-like flower (really a modified leaf).
Spraying an alocasia with warm soapy water every few weeks helps prevent mealy bugs, scale, aphids, and spider mite problems. It also keeps the large leaves of the plant dust-free. If an alocasia plant does become infested with houseplant pests, spray with an ultra fine commercial insecticidal oil. This kills both the pests and their eggs.
When over- watered or when the leaves get wet, Aloasia plants may develop a variety of diseases such as Crown, Stem, and Root Rot, Leaf Spot, and Xanthamonas. These diseases usually appear as dark brown or black spots on the leaves surrounded by a yellowish rim. The best way to prevent plant diseases is to avoid over-watering, keep the leaves dry, and provide good air circulation around the plant. Once an alocasia is infected, quickly remove the damaged leaves and any leaves that have fallen off, isolate the plant from your other plants, and treat with a commercial fungicide.
Use an organic well-aerated loose plant soil that contains a good amount of peat moss. If the soil seems a little heavy, add some builder’s sand or perlite.
Alocasia plants prefer to be root-bound in small pots. Do not increase the size of the container until the roots have filled the existing pot and always move to the next size pot only.
Quickly remove any yellow leaves or those that develop brown or black spots as that may be a sign of a fungal disease.
Alocasia plants are propagated by plant division. You can read more about propagation techniques in the Glossary.
These plants become dormant during the late fall and early winter. Don’t be concerned no new leaves develop during this time.
Alocasia plants are very poisonous houseplants with a #4 toxicity level."

The flowers of all peperomia plants are tiny & inconsequential, growing in clusters on upright, conical, red colored spikes. Peperomia Emerald Ripple is a compact plant that looks good on a desk or ta able. It even does well when planted outside as long as the temperature stays above 50°-55°F (10°-12.8°C). The Emerald Ripple variety is a close relative to the Peperomia Obtusifolia or Baby Rubber plant. 

Peperomia Frost-Silver caperata
Peperomia plants grow best in bright indirect light provided by a west or east facing, window. They also do well under florescent lights. Insufficient light causes this slow growing plant to stop growing all together. Direct sunlight burns the leaves.
Allow the top 50% of the soil in a peperomia plant to dry out before watering. Over-watering, causing yellow leaves and soggy stems, is the main cause of serious peperomia problems. Root-rot, which causes the plant to die, is the direct result of over–watering. Peperomia plants do well when watered from the bottom. This technique keeps water off of the leaves and helps prevent plant diseases. The thick leaves of a peperomia hold water and allow it to withstand long periods without moisture.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. It’s not necessary to feed a peperomia in the fall and winter.
Warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.5°-26.7°C) are best. Temperatures below 50°-55°F (10°-12.8°C) and cold drafts from windows and doors damage the leaves.
Peperomia plants are from the rain forests of Brazil and like a humid environment.
Peperomia flowers are small and inconsequential, growing at the top of tall stalks; it’s the leaves of a Peperomia plant that are more interesting.
Houseplant pests such as mealy bugs and aphids can be a problem.
Ringspot, a virus that marks the leaves of peperomia plants, and other houseplants, with unsightly round marks, may develop because of the high humidity this plant likes. Since there is no good treatment for ring spot disease, damaged leaves and even the entire infected plant may have to be thrown out. Keep the leaves of a peperomia plant dry and provide good air circulation to prevent ring spot disease. Over watering causes root rot.
Use a well-aerated potting soil that drains quickly. Peperomia plants are semi- succulents and do not like wet feet.
Repot only when the roots of the plant have out-grown the existing pot. Always move a peperomia plant to the next size pot only and be sure the pot has good drainage. Putting a peperomia in a pot that is too large allows the soil to stay wet too long and causes root rot.
A peperomia can be pruned at any point along the stem. New growth on the develops from the nodes just below the cut in the stem.
Peperomia plants are easily propagated from leaf cuttings, stem tip cuttings, and plant division. Be sure to allow the cut ends of the leaves or stems being used for propagation to dry out before planting them.
Peperomia plants are non-poisonous plants."
12,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/2,Hoya Hindu Rope Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/hoya-hindu-rope-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The unique Hoya Hindu Rope plant, Hoya carnosa compacta, is a draping succulent plant that produce clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers. The thick, twisted, curly, cupped leaves of a Hindu Rope plant are why it’s often called Krinkle Kurl. Hindu rope plants can be found in solid green or with variegated leaves. This type of hoya plant is very easy to care for as long as you have plenty of light and are careful with your water.
All Hindu Rope plants, both green and variegated, grow best in very bright light. Southern exposure is best, but it can adapt to east or west locations in front of a window. In lows light, a Hindu Rope plant may never bloom. Afternoon sun will burn and bleach the color from the leaves.
All hoya plants, including the Hindu Rope plant, are succulents that need very little water. Water when the soil is almost dry. During the winter, water all varieties of hoya plants even less.
Feed monthly during the spring and summer with a water-soluble plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Use a fertilizer high in potassium to encourage Hindu Rope plants to bloom.
Hindu Rope plants prefer daytime temperatures of 70 ° (F) or higher and nighttime temperatures between 60° and 65° (F). These temperatures encourage mature plants to flower during the late spring and summer.
Basic household humidity
Hindu Rope plants are slow growers that take several years to produce clusters of star-shaped waxy flowers on long vines. In bright light and when given the proper amount of food and water, they bloom in late spring & early summer. Do not remove the leafless spurs or stubs that appear on the plant; this is where the new flowers develop.
Mealy bugs are the most common houseplant pest that attacks Hindu Rope plants. Mealy Bugs get inside the curly twists and turns of the plant leaves. The best way to get rid of these plant pests is to spray all parts of Hindu Rope plant with the Green Solution. Aphids that may appear on new growth can also be treated with the Green Solution or an Insecticidal Soap.
The main plant diseases that affect a Hindu Rope HousePlants are Botrytis, a fungus that causes grayish areas on the leaves and Stem and Root Rot caused by over-watering.
Use a well-aerated fast-draining potting soil for Hindu Rope HousePlants. Add a little sand to the soil to loosen it up if the soil seems heavy.
Hindu Rope HousePlants should be kept in small pots to prevent over- watering.
Never totally cut off the old stems of a Hindu Rope House Plants since this is where the new flowers develop.
Hindu Rope HousePlants, Hoya carnosa “Krinkle Kurl,” can be propagated anytime using stem-tip cuttings. A portion of the Hoya Plant stem, including one or more pairs of leaves, quickly produces roots in water or damp sand.
Although not considered poisonous, a Hindu Rope Plant can make dogs and cats ill if they eat a large number of leaves.
The flowers of Hindu Rope Houseplants do produce a distinctive mocha aroma.
Do not remove the thick stalks, which are called Peduncles, that are growing on your Hindu Rope HousePlants since the plant’s flowers grow out of these peduncles. After blooming, if you don’t remove the dead flowers or the peduncles on Hindu Rope HousePlants, the plant produces even more flowers."
13,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/2,Chinese Evergreen Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/chinese-evergreen-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Chinese evergreen plant, Aglaonema , originally came from the subtropics of Southeast Asia. This plant is a member of the Araceae family and a close cousin to the alocasia, caladium, dieffenbachia, and philodendron. When small, the easy to grow Chinese evergreen plant can be used as an upright plant on a table, desk, or counter. As the plant matures and gets larger, it becomes a bushy floor plant. This is an extremely popular houseplant because its many varieties have different leaf colors and patterns. It is one on the few colorful plants that grow, though slowly, in lower light areas, and is drought tolerant.
There are many types of Chinese evergreen plants, all with shiny, oval, leathery leaves that have short stems. The leaves are usually 3″-5″ wide and up to12″ long. The original varieties had green and gray patterned leaves. The new hybrids have yellow, red, and pink in their leaves and require more light. A Chinese evergreen plant produces small, inconsequential flowers in the spring and summer that turn into red berries as the flowers fade. Flower production takes energy away from leaf development. Since the leaves of a Chinese evergreen are the attractive part of the plant, it’s recommended that the flowers be removed as soon as they appear.
The more color in the leaves, the more light the plant needs.
 Emerald Beauty (also called a “Maria”): Dark green leaves with silver markings
Amelia: Pale green leaves with medium green markings
Silver Queen: Silver, light green, and dark green patterned leaves that grow in thick clusters
Red Siam: Bright red and green patterned leaves
Moonshine: Yellow leaves with small splashes of green and pink
Red Valentine: Leaves have green edge; center of leaf is pink and bright red with splashes of green and cream.
Pictum Tricolor: Pointed oval leaves with splashes of light, medium, and dark green
Sparkling Sarah: Shiny leaves with a pink center vein and bold green and cream patterns. The stems of the leaves are also pink.
     
Red Siam Aurora                 Stardust                   Sparkling Sarah           Moonshine
Like all member of the Araceae family, a Chinese evergreen plant is poisonous and toxic to cats, dogs, and small children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  NASA does list the Chinese evergreen as one of the top ten plants to clean the air of harmful toxins
Chinese Evergreen plants are probably the only indoor plant with large, colorful, variegated leaves that can live in low-light conditions. If placed in medium light, these plants grow more quickly.
Allow the top 25-30% of the soil to dry out before watering. When the soil of a Chinese Evergreen plant is too wet, the stems become mushy and die. When the soil gets too dry or too wet, yellow leaves develop. The lower the light, the less water the plant needs.
Chinese Evergreen plants require very little plant food. Fertilize every other month with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength.
Warm temperatures between 70°F (21.1°C) and Temperatures below 50°F (10° C) can damage the leaves. Keep a Chinese Evergreen plant away from cold winter drafts and air conditioners.
Chinese Evergreen plants do well in regular household humidity or higher.
I usually remove Chinese Evergreen flowers as soon as they appear. The flowers are not very attractive and use energy that the plant needs to produce leaves.
Mealy bugs, scale, and aphids can be a problem for a Chinese Evergreen. Read more on how to identify and treat these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
In high humidity, the large leaves of a Chinese Evergreen may develop bacterial diseases such as Leaf Spot. Read more about leaf Spot disease and how to identify and treat it in the Glossary of the website.
Use a well-aerated potting soil that drains quickly for a Chinese Evergreen plant. If the soil does not dry out quickly, root rot may develop.
Keeping a Chinese Evergreen a little root-bound in a small pot is another way of preventing the soil from staying wet too long and causing root rot.
If a Chinese Evergreen plant becomes thin and leggy, prune the stems back to where they are bending. Cut the stem directly above a leaf node. The plant will branch out all along the length of the remaining stem.
Stem cuttings and plant division are the best way to propagate a Chinese Evergreen plant. You can read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
NASA lists the Chinese Evergreen as one of the top 10 plants to clean the air of harmful chemicals.
Chinese Evergreen contain calcium oxalate crystals and are poisonous plants with a #2 toxicity level. Adverse reactions include: skin irritations after contact with the sap, irritation of mouth, lips, throat, and tongue if leaves are eaten. Please keep this plant away from small children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
I would remove the flowers from a Chinese Evergreen plant as soon as they appear. The flowers of a Chinese Evergreen Plant hinder leaf growth, are not very attractive, and produce berries that weaken the plant.
Propagating a Chinese Evergreen plant is very simple and is done by Stem Cuttings or plant division.
The sticky “stuff” on the leaves of your Chinese Evergreen Plant is called “honeydew.” Honeydew is excreted by a plant pest called Mealy Bugs. Mealy Bugs are small sucking insects that look like tiny pieces of cotton.
The stems of a Chinese Evergreen Plant get soft and mushy when the plant is over-watered. The lower the light the less water a Chinese Evergreen needs. Move your Chinese Evergreen to a brighter, warmer location until the soil dries out. Once you move your plant back to its original location, be sure to allow the top 25%-30% of the soil to dry out before watering."
14,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/2,Bromeliad Plant – Silver Vase,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bromeliad-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Bromeliad plant (Aechmea fasciata), sometimes called a Silver Vase plant or Urn plant, is an easy care flowering plant native to Brazil. In nature, it is an epiphytic plant, which means it grows on other plants or trees. This bromeliad variety has thick, arching, gray-green leaves.These unique leaves are arranged in a circular fashion so that they form an upturned waxy cup in the center. This central cup, or reservoir collects the water and nutrients that the plant needs. After three or four years, as a Bromeliad fasciata matures, the plant produces a tall flower stalk with numerous pink bracts.This bromeliad variety has thick, arching, gray-green leaves.These unique leaves are arranged in a circular fashion so that they form an upturned waxy cup in the center. The real flowers are small blue blooms that grow between the pink bracts. Although the blue flowers quickly die, the bright pink bracts often last 5 or 6 months in a cool room with no bright light.  When buying a Bromeliad fasciata, avoid purchasing one that already has small blue flowers since this indicates the pink bracts have been visible for a while and may soon fade.
A Bromelia fasciata (Silvr Vase Plant) requires very bright light in order to flower. Once the pink bracts appear, move the plant to lower light to prolong the colorful bracts.
Keep the “cup” of this type of bromeliad filled with fresh water. Clean the cup weekly and replace the water with clean water to prevent diseases, gnats, and mosquitos. Dampen the soil and do not water again until the top 1/2” of soil has dried out. Never allow the soil to totally dry out and never use hard water. The lime in hard water disfigures the leaves. These plants have a very small root system so be careful not to over-water.
Feed monthly in the spring, summer, and fall with a liquid plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. During the winter, fertilize a every other month. The best way to fertilize is to spray the liquid food directly on the leaves. Never put food into the central cup.
The colorful bracts last longer if you keep the temperature between 6o°-75° F (17°- 24° C). Aechmea fasciatas can survive colder temperatures than other bromeliads.
Bromeliads need moderate humidity.
After three or four years, once the plant matures, a bromeliad archaea fasciata produces a tall flower stalk with numerous pink bracts. The real flowers are small blue blooms that grow between the bracts. Although the tiny blue flowers quickly die, the bright pink bracts often last for 5 or 6 months when the temperature is cool and the light low.
Change the water and clean the cup every 7-10 days to prevent plant pests such as gnats, mosquitos, mealy bugs, and scale.
Fungal plant diseases such as root rot, crown rot, rust disease, and leaf spot can infect bromeliads.
I recommend using either a bromeliad or orchid potting soil. If you want to make your own mix, use equal parts leaf mold, peat moss and coarse sand or equal parts fir bark, peat moss, and sharp sand or perlite.
As the young bromeliad matures and outgrows a 4” or 6” pot, move it to the next size pot in the spring. After 3 or 4 years, the plant reaches maturity and should remain in an 8″ pot. Bromeliads like to be root-bound in small pots so don’t rush to re-pot them.
Bromeliads are propagated using the “pups” or offsets that grow around the base of the plant. Wait until these offsets are about 6” (15 cm) in size before digging them up and planting them in a 4” pot of their own.
Bromeliads remove formaldehyde from the air.
Although considered a non-poisonous houseplant, a bromeliad contains substances that may cause skin irritations and contact dermatitis in some people and pets.
The rust colored spots on the leaves of your bromeliad sound like a plant disease called rust which is caused by a fungus. This plant disease appears as rust colored blisters on the underside of bromeliad leaves. The blisters eat their way through the leaves causing white or light yellow spots on the tops of the leaves.
The bright pink flower on a Bromeliad fasciata is really numerous bracts. These bracts begin to fade and die after a few weeks to a few months depending on how long the bromeliad plant had those bracts before you purchased the plant. Hopefully the plant will produce some off-sets you can use to start new bromeliad plants.
In order to get your bromeliad leaves to have that silvery gray color you need to put it in very bright light and fertilize more. Feed a bromeliad fasciata monthly in the spring, summer and fall with a liquid plant food at ½ the recommended strength. During the winter, fertilize every other month. The best way to deliver plant food is to spray the fertilizer on the leaves. This helps the color, but not the size of the leaves."
15,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/2,Calathea Ornata,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/calathea-plant-ornata-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Calathea ornata is native to Africa, the West Indies, and Central and South America and has large, oval, vibrantly colored striped leaves. The beautiful leaves of the Calathea “ornata” grow at the end of long stems and require quite a bit of care to stay looking good. Although a close relative of the prayer plant, a calathea definitely require more attention.
Indoors, this plant rarely grows larger than about 2ft. wide and 2ft. tall. The leaves of the calathea ornata are smaller than those of other calathea plants and have bright pink stripes. The pink coloring of the “roseolineata” variety is even more vibrant.
High humidity is a must or the plant gets brown leaf tips. Place the plant on a wet pebble tray if the air is very dry
Keep soil barely moist at all times and avoid using water that contains any chemicals including salt.
Bright , indirect light
Fertilize only when the plan is actively growing
A calathea plant requires bright indirect light but no direct sun. Direct sun burns the leaves and causes the vibrant colors to fade.
The leaves of calathea plants are easily damaged by the quality of the water you use. Hard water or soft water, water with a high chemical content (fluorine, chlorine, or salt), water that has passed through a softener, or water of poor quality causes leaf tip burn. Use distilled water, rain water, or allow your tap water to sit out over night before using it. Calathea plants like moist but not soggy, soil at all times; never let the plant sit in water. Allow the top 2-3” of the soil to dry out before watering.
Fertilize monthly in the spring, summer, and fall with a basic houseplant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Never feed a calathea or any houseplant, if it is not actively growing.
Calathea plants prefer temperatures between 65°-80°F (18.3°-27.7°C) , and don’t do well in cold drafts or temperatures below 55°-60°F (12.8°-15.6°C). The leaves of a calathea plant curl when the temperature is too warm.
Calathea plants need high humidity and when the air is too dry they develop brown leaf edges. Increase the humidity by placing the plant on a tray of wet pebbles (be sure the container is on the pebbles and not in the water), setting a humidifier near-by, or by grouping plants together to create a mini-greenhouse effect.
Calathea plant leaves are more beautiful than many flowers. With hundreds of calathea varieties available, some, such as Calathea crocata, White Ice, and Brazilian have gorgeous flowers as well as spectacular leaves.
Spider mites, aphids, mealy bug, and scale
Calathea plants require high humidity and this encourages bacterial and fungal diseases which appear as leaf lesions.
Grow well in a light, porous, indoor potting soil that retains water but still drains quickly; an African Violet soil mixture is a good choice.
Calathea plants rarely need re-potting.
The only pruning a calathea needs is the removal of brown or crispy leaves.
Calathea plants are difficult to propagate; if you want to try, plant division is the best method.
Calathea are non-poisonous plants.
The light is probably a little TOO bright. Direct sun burns the leaves of most houseplants and causes their vibrant colors to fade.
The flowers on a Calathea are beautiful and you should let them stay on as long as possible and enjoy them. With plants like a Coleus, that has beautiful leaves and small inconsequential flowers, I recommend immediately pinching off the flowers.
Calathea plant leaves may get brown leaf edges for many reasons: Your water has too many chemicals in it. The water is too hard or too soft or it has passed through a softener. You are giving the plant too much plant food.The plant is in direct sun and is getting a sun burn. Perhaps there is insufficient humidity in the air. Distinct brown spots on the leaves usually indicate a bacterial or fungal plant disease."

It is also called an Australian Ivy Palm and a Hawaiian Umbrella Tree. The plant was originally found growing as a flowering outdoor plant in Taiwan and is native to Australia as well. and is still grown outdoors in moderate climates around the world.
As an indoor houseplant, a Hawaiian Schefflera can be as small as 5″ and be used in dish gardens. Hawaiian Scheffleras are perfect table or floor plants for home or office. and are also an excellent choice if you want to try your hand at the art of bonsai. A Hawaiian schefflera, like its close cousin the Schefflera actinophylla or Umbrella tree plant, can also be a specimen tree reaching a height of six feet or more. This attractive plant is available with braided stems and also as bonsai plant. A Hawaiian Schefflera has masses of small, shiny, leathery leaves. The leaves are arranged palmately with 7-9 leaflets per leaf. The leaflets are small, ranging in size from about 3”- 7” (7.5-18 centimeters) in length and 2”- 4” (5- 10 centimeters) in width.
The regular Hawaiian Schefflera has solid green leaves, the Hawaiian Schefflera Gold Capella has gold and green leaves, and the Hawaiian Schefflera Trinette (also called “Janine”) has white and green leaves. This is a versatile plant that will tolerate some neglect and less than perfect growing conditions.
       
Trinette                                 Gold Capella
Provide bright, indirect light
Be careful not to over water or green leaves fall off or turn black
Keep the temperature above 55°F (12.8°C) and below 70° F (21.1°C)
Watch out for scale and spider mites
A Hawaiian Schefflera is a toxic plant and should be kept away from dogs, cats, and small children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
The brighter the light the faster and bushier a Hawaiian schefflera plant grows. Variegated Hawaiian scheffleras, like the “capella” variety, require more light than solid green varieties. Direct sun burns the leaves on all varieties of schefflera.
Water well and then allow the top 1/3 of the soil to dry out before watering again. Seemingly healthy leaves fall off and new growth turns black when a Hawaiian schefflera is over- watered. Leaves turn bright yellow when the plant needs more water.
Fertilize a Hawaiian schefflera plant monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to one half the recommended strength. Avoid feeding when the plant is not actively growing.
Hawaiian scheffleras grow well in normal household temperatures. Try to keep the plant out of cold drafts and away from heaters and air conditioners.
Normal household humidity.
Although a Hawaiian schefflera often flowers when grown outdoors, it must be a mature plant and be in an ideal area to flower as an indoor houseplant.
Spider Mites, scale, aphids, and mealy bugs all like scheffleras. These annoying insects especially like the tender, new growth. Read more about these pests and how to get rid of them in the Glossary of the website.
Bacterial leaf diseases such as leaf blight and fungal leaf diseases such as leaf spot disease are a problem when the leaves are kept wet and the humidity is high.
Use a well-aerated loose potting soil that retains water but still drains quickly.
Hawaiian scheffleras prefer to be root-bound in small pots. This also helps prevent over-watering.
Aggressively prune a Hawaiian schefflera when it gets too large or looks thin and leggy. All schefflera plants love to be trimmed. New growth appears directly below the cut in the stem.
Stem cuttings, or if the schefflera plant has a thick trunk, air layering are the best ways to propagate a Hawaiian Schefflera plant. Read more details about using stem cuttings and air layering propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Hawaiian scheffleras are considered to be slightly poisonous plants with a #1 toxicity level. Keep this plant out of reach of small children and pets.
The leaves on a Hawaiian schefflera pplant turn black and green leaves fall off when the plant is over-watered. Read more about how to water a schefflera plant in the care section of the Schefflera plant page. You should also check to be sure there are no plant pests such as Mealy Bugs, Aphids, or spider mites feeding on the new growth of your schefflera plant.
A solid green Hawaiian schefflera grows best in bright indirect light, but will still grow slowly near a small light and with good artificial light. Leaves may be smaller and the plant a little less bushy than if it had brighter light. Don’t use the capella variety (variegated Hawaiian schefflera) since it needs more light to maintain the yellow coloring in the leaves.
The leaves of your Hawaiian schefflera are losing their color and the webs on the plant are both caused by a plant pest called spider mites. Spray with the “ green solution” (recipe in the Glossary) every 10 days for at least a month.
All schefflera plants, both the Hawaiian schefflera and Umbrella Tree schefflera, develop yellow leaves when they are not getting enough water. How you water a schefflera plant is very important. When you water, water well enough so that the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot that the schefflera is planted in. Do not water your schefflera again until the top 1/3 of the soil has dried out. If green leaves fall off, you’ve over compensated and are now giving your schefflerat too much water."

White blooms on a Hoya Shooting Star plant appear in large clusters, with the waxy petals leaning back behind the center of the flower, like shooting stars. There are over 200 species of the easy to grow almost indestructible hoya plant. These plants are often referred to as Wax Plants because of the waxy nature of their leaves and flowers.  Hoya plants grow well and produce more flowers when hanging in front of a window that gets bright, indirect light. Even a houseplant novice will be successful growing a Hoya plant if they don’t over water and cause stem and root rot.
Hoya Plants do best and bloom more in very bright light. They are one of the few indoor houseplants that can even thrive in morning, direct sun. Although a Hoya Shooting Star plant can adapt to lower light, they grow slower and do not produce the fragrant porcelain- like flowers that are so beautiful.
These are succulent plants and need to completely dry out before being watered. Hoya Shooting Star plants do thrive on neglect, but need additional water when in bloom.
Feed monthly with a balanced houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength when he plant actively growing.
Hoya Plants can adapt to any temperature but prefer 70°-80°F ( 21.1°-26,7°C) during the day and 60°-65°F (15.5°-18.3°C) at night.
Provide basic household humidity or lower for a Hoya plant.
A Hoya Shooting Star plant produces beautiful clusters of fragrant flowers in white and yellow. Each Hoya flower has five waxy petals. New flowers develop on the old flower stems, so never cut off the old stems.
Hoya plants are prone to plant pests such as mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids. If infected, spray the entire plant, reaching every little twisted section if possible, with the Green Solution ( directions on how to make this non-toxic solution in the Glossary of the website).
The main Hoya plant diseases are Botrytis, a fungus that causes grayish areas on the leaves and Stem and Root Rot caused by over-watering. Details on how to identify and treat these diseases in the Glossary of the website.
Use a well-aerated fast-draining potting soil for a Hoya plant. Add a little sand to the soil to loosen it up if the soil seems heavy..
Pot size for a Hoya plant should be no larger that 1″-2″ bigger than the root ball and must have drip holes in the bottom so excess water can drain out.
Never cut off all of the old stems of a Hoya Shooting Star Plant since this is where the new flowers develop.
Hoya Plants are easy to propagate using stem clippings from the new vines. Read more about propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Although not considered poisonous, Hoya Plants can make dogs and cats ill if they eat a large number of leaves..
Hoya flower buds dry up and fall off if the plant gets very dry. Hoya flower buds get spongy and fall off when the plant is over-watered.
The main reason mature Hoya Plants don’t bloom is because they are not getting enough light.
Hoya plants bloom very well under fluorescent light."

The dracaena lemon lime has 12”-24” long sword shaped leaves with bright green and yellow stripes. Like other dracaena plants, the leaves are arranged in a rosette and grow off a very thick stem. A dracaena lemon lime is very easy to care for and can easily reach a height of 5ft-7ft. indoors. It also makes a beautiful bush. Because of the bright colors in the leaves, the dracaena lemon lime needs a little more light than other dracaenas. It’s a great plant to brighten up any room in your house. Dracaena plants are considered to be poisonous to cats and dogs by the ASPCA. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Although a Dracaena lemon lime Plant can adapt to low light, it does better in medium to indirect bright light. Too much direct bright light causes the color in the leaves to fade. Too little light and the new leaves are narrower than the older leaves.
Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. Dracaenas are very sensitive to chemicals in the water. If your household water contains a lot of fluorine or chlorine, allow it to sit out over night before using it. Never use water that has passed through a water softener, it is too salty.
Dracaenas require very little fertilizer. Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced, liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. the recommended strength. It’s not necessary to feed dracaenas in the fall or winter.
Provide warm temperatures between 70°-75°F (21.1°-23.9°C).
Dracaenas like high humidity but do well in basic household humidity.
Although a dracaena lemon lime does bloom, it rarely flowers as a potted plant. White flowers may appear in summer if the plant gets bright indirect light but no direct sun.
Mealy bugs and spider mites are the houseplant pests to look out for. Keeping the leaves clean and dust free helps prevent pest problems.
Fluoride toxicity causes long, tan to dark brown spots in the yellow stripes of dracaena lemon lime leaves. Fusarium leaf spot disease produces reddish/ tan spots with wide, yellow halos on the new leaves.
Use a fast-draining well-aerated loose soil. Dracaenas can even be grown in soil mixed with lava rock.
A Dracaena lemon lime likes to be root-bound in small pots. Re-pot to the next size pot when the roots have filled the existing pot.
Cut brown leaf tips off with a wet scissors. Tall stalks with only a few leaves at the top, can be cut anywhere along the stalk. New growth appears below the cut area.
A dracaena lemon llme is propagated by stem cuttings.
NASA recommends dracaenas as good plants to clean the air of harmful chemicals.
The ASPCA considers a dracaena lemon lime a poisonous plant to dogs and cats.
You can save a cold damaged dracaena lemon lime. As long as the temperature was above 45° the roots should be fine; but you will have quite few black leaves to remove.
Leaves of a Dracaena Lemon Lime or Striped Dracaena plant get blotchy and have a reddish haze when they are being attacked by a houseplant pest called spider mites. Spray your dracaena plant with the green solution (recipe in the Glossary) every 10 days for a month.
Dark brown tips on the leaves of a Dracaena Lemon Lime can be a sign of over- watering, too much fluoride in the water, too much fertilizer, or severe under-watering.Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering, fertilize monthly in the spring and summer but never in the fall and winter, and use water that does not have fluoride or chlorine in it."

It has many common names such as Hope Selloum, Horsehead Philodendron, Lacy Tree Philodendron, Philodendron Hope Selloum, and Tree Philodendron, and is often confused with the philodendron xanadu. This is a non-climbing, tree philodendron that spreads outward rather than growing upward. When grown as an indoor plant, the easy-care, self-heading philodendron selloum takes up a lot of space, often spreading out 5ft. or more with dark green, shiny, deeply lobed leaves that can be 2ft-3ft (60-90cm) long. This plant does grow a trunk as it matures; however, the leaves do a very good job of hiding it.
Bright, indirect light but no direct sun
Moist soil at all times, drier in the winter
Minimum temperature 55°F (12.8°C)
Avoid over fertilizing, feed monthly in spring, summer, and fall
Prefers high humidity
Propagate using cuttings in summer
Use a light, airy peat based soil
Leaves turning yellow – indicates root rot due to over watering
Leaves curling – the air is too dry, too cold, or both
Soft, discolored stems or mushy leaves – caused by over watering
Brown leaf tips- check the soil since this can be the result of over or under watering
Drooping leaves – again, check the soil since this can be the result of over or under watering
Dark patches on the leaves – usually a sign of a plant disease called Bacterial Blight
If you have a large area that gets bright, indirect light, this bold, dramatic looking plant is a beautiful addition to your home. You can easily control the shape and size of the plant by cutting off some of the leaves. However, If you’re looking for a flowering plant, this one is not a good choice. It takes approximately 15–20 years for an indoor selloum to produce flowers. A philodendron selloum is a poisonous plant and toxic to small children, dogs, cats, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a philodendron selloum: Place the plant in bright indirect light but avoid direct sun. In lower light the leaves turn a darker green. Too much light or direct sun burns the leaves and causes the deep green color to fade.
How to water a philodendron selloum: Unlike other philodendrons, the selloum likes moist but not soggy soil. During the winter, water less, keeping the soil barely moist.
How to fertilize a philodendron selloum: Feed monthly during the spring, summer, and fall with a water-soluble, balanced plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Too much plant food causes a salt build up in the soil and leaf burn. The leaves on a philodendron selloum turn pale green when the plant needs more fertilizer.
Best temperature for a philodendron selloum: Warm temperatures above 55°F (12.8°C). Keep these plants away from cold drafts and open doors during the winter.
Does a philodendron selloum need high humidity: This is a tree philodendron and has thinner leaves than many of its relatives. It requires a humid environment to grow well. If your home or office is very dry, especially during the in winter, place your selloum near a humidifier or sit it on a wet pebble tray.
Does a philodendron selloum flower: It takes about 15-20 years for a mature plant to flower; and it rarely flowers indoors. The pedal-less flowers are enclosed in a spathe, a modified leaf, which is often mistaken for the flower itself.
Philodendron selloum plant pests: Aphids, mealy bugs, scale, and spider mites can be a problem. If you find any of these pests, spray the entire plant with warm soapy water or the Green Solution (recipe in the Glossary). Scrape off scale with a child’s toothbrush. You can read more about these plant pests, and how to identify and treat them, in the Glossary of the website.
Philodendron selloum plant diseases: Bacterial blight, caused by the high humidity the plant prefers, causes small, very dark green blotches on the leaves that expand rapidly. Infected leaves eventually rot and die becoming quite smelly in the process. The best way to prevent bacterial blight is to keep the leaves dry at all times, avoid overhead watering, immediately remove any infected leaves. and provide good air circulation around the plant.
Best soil for a philodendron selloum: Use a rich, slightly alkaline, peat moss based soil that retains moisture but still drains quickly.
Pot size for a philodendron selloum: It’s time to move the plant to a larger pot when the roots have filled the existing pot. The new container should only be 1″-2″ wider and deeper than the previous pot. Re-potting is usually done about every two years in the spring.
How to prune a philodendron selloum: Use a sharp pruners or scissors to control the size and shape of the plant. You can remove entire leaves by cutting them off at the base of the leaf stem. Remove the lower leaves if you want to reveal the plant’s stem. Always wear gloves and long sleeved shirts when pruning and wash your hands and tools when finished. You don’t want to get the sap into your eyes, mouth, or any open cuts.
How to propagate a philodendron selloum: Propagate using stem cuttings taken from the base of the stem during the warm summer months. Read more about how to propagate a plant using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Is a philodendron selloum poisonous to cats, dogs, and small children: This is is a poisonous houseplant with a level #3 toxicity. All philodendron varieties contain calcium oxalate crystals. Eating any part of the plant may cause the following symptoms: pain in the mouth, drooling (dogs & cats), and vomiting. If swelling of the lips, tongue, and airway occurs, it becomes difficult to breathe or swallow.
When a philodendron s has too much salt in the soil, usually from too much plant food or from using water that has passed through a water softener, the leaf tips turn brown and curl. Always dilute your plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength and never use water for any houseplants that has passed through a water softener. Drench the soil with some distilled water and feed your Philodendron Selloum less often.
The very dark green spots between the veins on the leaves of your philodendron selloum are caused by low room temperature. These plants like to be warm and cozy so always keep the temperature above 55°F (12.8°C) and never place the plant near an air conditioner in the summer or a door during the winter.
The leaves on a philodendron selloum usually turn pale green when the plant needs more fertilizer or if the plant is getting too much bright light."
20,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Episcia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/episcia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Episcias are lovely trailing plants native to Central and South America, Brazil, and the West Indies. An Episcia plant is grown for its colorful textured leaves and small but pretty flowers. The most popular variety of the Episcia plant is the Flame Violet which has silver veined leaves and bears tubular bright pink or orange-red flowers about 3/4″ in size. The Episcia has never become as popular as its close relative the African Violet because they require more care. Episcias grow in a very unique manner. Each plant sends out runners called stolons which trail over the edge of the container or across the soil in the pot. New plants are propagated from these runners.This is a beautiful unique houseplant, but not a good plant for beginners.
    
Episcia Plants require bright light but no direct sun. If the light is too bright, the color in the leaves fades.
The soil of an Episcia plant should be moist but not soggy at all times. If the soil is too dry, the leaves develop brown edges. In the winter, when an Episcia is not growing, allow the soil to become a little drier.
Special African Violet plant fertilizer is great for Episcia plants. In a pinch, use a balanced, soluble, houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing.
Average household temperatures above 65°F (18.3°C). Lower temperatures may cause brown leaf edges. An Episcia plant usually dies when the temperature goes below 50°F ( 10°C).
Episcia plants like high humidity especially as the temperature in the room increases.
The “Flame Violet” variety of the Episcia plant produces orange-red tubular flowers and the e. dianthiflora variety produces larger white fringed flowers. Moderate to high humidity is essential for an Episcia plant to flower.
Spider Mites and Mealy Bugs can be a problem. Check often and use a Qtip dipped in alcohol or Neem Oil to treat any plant pests as soon as they appear. Since the leaves of an Episcia plant are easily damaged, only use commercial insecticides recommended for African Violet plants.
Episcia plants thrive and bloom in high humidity which makes them susceptible to Botritis, Powdery Mildew, and Erwinia Blight. Preventing these plant diseases is easier than treating them so try to provide good air circulation and avoid misting the leaves of an Episcia.
Episcia plants like a rich, airy potting medium. These plants are relatives of African Violets, so special African Violet plant soil is a good choice.
Episcia plants should be re-potted once a year with fresh soil. This helps prevent unwanted salt build-up that can damage the roots. If their roots have taken on the shape of the pot, it’s time to move your Episcia to the next size pot.
It’s best to remove the small, developing stolons (runners), to allow the plant to develop well. Episcias grow very quickly, and can look straggly if not actively pruned. Trim the stolons (runners) to keep the plant full and bushy.
Episcia plants produce thread like runners or stolens that root in the surrounding soil. These runners develop small plantlets at their tips. Propagation is very easy using these plantlets.
An Episcia is a non – poisonous houseplant.
Just allow the plantlets on your Episcia to grow a little larger, once they are at least an inch or two in size and can grow on their own, cut them off the stolen and root them in a separate pot. Episcais are very easy to propagate.
No, it’s not a fertilizer problem. I think your Episcia is getting too much bright light. Is it getting any direct sun any time during the day? It shouldn’t be!! Try moving it to a location that’s not quite as bright and I bet the vibrant color in leaves returns.
The edges of the leaves of an Episcia plant turn brown when the air around the plant is too cold. Episcia Plants really need temperatures of 65 degrees or more. Try to keep them away from cold windows and winter drafts."
21,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Dracaena Compacta,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/how-to-grow-a-dracaena-compacta-plant-care-guide/,,,"The Dracaena compacta plant, a compact, slow growing member of the Dracaena family, is native to South East Africa. It is often referred to as Dracaena fragrans or Dracaena deremensis. The closest relative of the Compacta is the Dracaena janet craig, but the Compacta is quite different in appearance. The Dracaena Compacta has a thick green stems with several clumps of short, dark green leaves 2″-4″ in length on each stem. This plant is beautiful addition to homes or offices, but it’s a bit more difficult and more expensive than other dracaenas. Dracaena compacta plants are considered by some to be slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A Dracaena compacta plant grows best in medium light. In low light area they grow very slowly or not at all, tend to lose bottom leaves more quickly, and are easily over-watered. Rotate dracaenas weekly so that they don’t grow toward the light, become one sided, and lose their beautiful shape..
Like other indoor houseplants, a dracaena compacta uses less water in low light than in brighter light. Keep the plant on the dry side to prevent root rot and leaf spot disease. Allow the top ¾ of the soil to dry out before watering. In low light this could be two weeks or more. Compacta plants do better when watered on a regular schedule. Dark brown tips usually indicate the following: too much chlorine or fluoride in the water, water is too salty (never use water that has passed through a softener), or too much plant food. Muddy brown leaf tips on new growth means the plant needs more water.
Slow growing plants like the dracaena compacta, require very little fertilizer. Feed only twice a year, once in the spring and once in the summer, and be sure to dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended stength.
Dracaena compacta plants like warm room temperatures 60-75°F (16-24°C). Cold winter drafts and heaters can damage the leaves.
Basic household or office humidity is fine.
Dracaenas rarely flower, when they do, I recommend immediately cutting off the flowers. Allowing the flowers to stay on the plant may distort the growth pattern of the plant and ruin its shape.
Mealy bugs and scale can be a problem.
Leaf Spot disease, caused by a fungus living in the soil, causes reddish brown spots on the new leaves. Over- watering causes root rot. The best way to prevent both of these problems is to let the soil dry out before watering the plant.
Use a good, loose houseplant soil that drains quickly.
Dracaena plants like to be root- bound in small pots. If you move the plant to a larger container (with drip holes in the bottom) remember it will take the soil longer to dry out.
Quickly remove dead or dying canes. Prune brown or yellow leaf tips with a wet scissors.
Dracaena Compacta plants are propagated using stem cuttings.
NASA lists dracaenas as excellent plants for removing benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene from the air.
There is a lot of disagreement as to whether Dracaenas are poisonous houseplants. I give them a #1 toxicity level. Dracaenas may cause intestinal issues if eaten by a small child, dog, or cat.
There are several reasons why the tips of the leaves of Dracaena houseplants turn brown. Fluorine, chlorine, and salt in the water is one reason dracaenas get brown tips. Try using distilled water, or allow your household water to sit out overnight so the chemicals in it can dissipate. Too much plant food and using water that has passed through a softener also causes brow tips on dracaena plants.
Many dracaena houseplants come planted in lava rock, and it makes it very hard to tell when they need water. I always recommend replacing at least 1/3 of the lava rock with good potting soil.
These plants like to practically dry out before being watered. If the new growth has muddy brown leaf tips you are under watering. However, it could also mean that you are using water that has too much chlorine, fluoride, or salt in it. You may also be giving you Dracaena Plants too much plant food."
22,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Swedish Ivy Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/swedish-ivy-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Swedish Ivy, Plectranthus australis, did not originate in Sweden, nor is it a type of ivy plant. It did, however, originally become popular as a houseplant in Sweden, and these do have long cascading stems like a regular ivy plant. Swedish Ivies are part of the Plectranthus genus, and a member of the Lamiaceae family. It is a close relative of the mint plant. Other names for a Swedish Ivy are “Creeping Charlie” and “Swedish Begonia.” This easy-care houseplant, native to South Africa, can also be grown as a hardy, perennial, outdoor plant in areas where the temperature stays above 50°F.
Swedish Ivies are lush, almost succulent – like plants with long, trailing, thick stems. The 1”-1.5” leaves are rounded with scalloped edges. The thick, bright green leaves are shaped more like a coleus leaf than an ivy leaf. When given enough bright light, a Swedish Ivy produces delicate, white, lavender, or purple tubular-shaped flowers throughout the year. Some varieties even have a special aroma when touched.
White-Edged Swedish Ivy (Plectranthus coleoides “variegatea”) has dark green leaves with white scalloped edges, and grows about 10”-12” tall and 15”-20” wide.
Purple Swedish Ivy (Plectranthus Purpuratus) when placed in bright light, has deeply veined, richly colored greenish purple leaves with purple undersides and tall stalks of small flowers in white, pink, purple, and bluish purple.
Emerald Lace Swedish Ivy (Plectranthus oertendahlii) is a compact plant that has green leaves with silver-colored veins and scalloped edges. The underside of the leaf is purple, and the small flowers are lilac in color.
Plectranthus “Mona Lavender” Swedish Ivy (Plectranthus ecklonii) has 2” dark green leaves with purple undersides. It produces long spikes of showy lavender blossoms from fall into spring.
Vick’s Plant (Plectranthus tomentosus) is commonly known as a “Vicks Plant” because the small, dark green, fuzzy, velvety leaves smell like Vick’s Vap-O-Rub when rubbed. The showy flowers are usually mauve, purple, or white.

Wait until leaves get a little soft and flexible before watering
Bright indirect light but no direct sun
Easily propagated using stem tip cuttings in spring or summer
Use a fertilizer high in nitrogen
A Swedish Ivy makes a wonderful houseplant, growing quickly even for new plant enthusiasts. It’s best displayed in a hanging basket where its long vines, sometimes 2-3ft in length and covered in colorful tubular flowers, can be enjoyed. This is a non-toxic plant and safe to have around small children, dogs, cats, and other pets.
A Swedish Ivy requires bright indirect light, but no direct sun. Inadequate light causes a Swedish Ivy to “reach’ for the light and become leggy.
Allow the top 30% of the soil to dry out before watering a Swedish Ivy. The easiest way to kill a Swedish Ivy is by over-watering and causing root rot. Yellow leaves indicate the plant is over-watered. The leaves become soft and dull green when a Swedish Ivy needs water.
Fertilize a Swedish Ivy every two weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively producing new leaves. Use a plant food high in nitrogen, diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Provide temperatures between 70°-75°F (21.1°-23.9°C) most of the year for a Swedish Ivy. During the winter, when the plant is not actively growing, cooler temperatures of 60°-65°F (15.6°-23.9°C) are best.
Although a Swedish Ivy prefers high humidity, it still grows quickly in regular household humidity.
In ideal growing conditions, a Swedish Ivy produces small purple, lavender, pink, or white tubular flowers during the spring and summer.
Aphids, whitefly, scale, and especially mealy bugs can infest a Swedish Ivy. You can see a picture of these plant pests and read how to identify and treat them, in the Glossary of the website.
Leaf Spot is the most common plant disease that infects a Swedish Ivy. Learn how to identify and treat leaf spot disease in the Glossary of the website.
A Swedish Ivy grows well in an organic, peat moss- based soil that drains well.
Do not rush to move a Swedish Ivy to a larger container. Wait until the roots have filled the current pot and then move the plant to the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape.
A Swedish Ivy needs constant pruning to keep it looking full and bushy. Trim several inches off the long vines to encourage new growth. The plant cuttings can be used to propagate new plants.
Use stem cuttings to easily propagate a Swedish Ivy. Read more about propagation techniques and exactly how to do it in the Glossary of the website.
A Swedish Ivy is a non-poisonous plant.
The main reason Swedish Ivy indoor plants get thin and leggy is not enough light. Prune the tips of the stems of your Swedish Ivy, move it to brighter light, and watch how bushy it becomes.
I always cut the flowers off of my Swedish Ivy plants. When the flowers are left on the plant, it slows down leaf production.
The leaves on a Swedish Ivy are usually soft and droopy when the plant needs more water. Another reason could be that the plant is in a location that is too hot. If the soil is damp and the room not too hot, you may have over-watered your Swedish Ivy and caused root rot. In that case, take some leaf tip cuttings and propagate a new plant before the old one dies."

This is a short fern that grows to be about a foot tall, but its fronds can spread outwards 2-3 feet or more. A Kangaroo Paw fern does not need much fertilizer and likes to be warm. This is a unique looking, easy care fern that is very attractive in a hanging basket or set on a table in a pretty pot.
Medium to bright indirect light. Keep in the shade outside.
Water a kangaroo paw fern when the top 50% of the soil has dried out. When watering, give the plant enough water so that it drains out the bottom drip holes. I don’t recommend misting this or any other houseplant because keeping the leaves wet encourages bacterial and fungus infections.
Fertilize once a month in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. You can also use an organic fish emulsion. Kangaroo paw ferns should never be fertilized in the fall and winter. Ferns do not require much plant food so when in doubt, don’t feed.
These ferns like warm temperatures 70°-75°F (21.1°-23.9°C) in the spring, summer, and fall, but prefer cooler temperatures 60°-65°F (15.6°-18.3°C) and brighter light in the winter.
High humidity is best, but a kangaroo paw fern still does well in lower household humidity.
Scale, aphids, mealy bugs. Ferns are very sensitive to insecticides, so try to use warm, soapy water or the Green Solution (recipe in Glossary).
Not many diseases affect kangaroo paw ferns. In very humid conditions, bacterial or fungal infections may occur.
Use a porous coarse soil that drains well.
Repot in the spring if the roots have filled the existing pot.
Remove dead fronds as soon as they appear; cut the dead fronds off at the soil line. Clean the leaves with a damp cloth.
Kangaroo paw ferns can be propagated using many techniques: spores, rhizome division, layering, and plantlets. Fern propagation should be done in the spring before the plant starts to actively produce new growth.
These are non-poisonous houseplants.
The “feet” on Rabbit’s Foot and Kangaroo Ferns are really rhizomes that grow across the top of the soil surface and sometimes even grow over part of the pot.
If the bumps are raised with a hard exterior and you can scrape them off, it is scale. scale is a plant insect that you can read about in the Glossary of the website. If the bumps are flat and part of the leaf they are spores which are used for propagation.
The tired, pale appearance of indoor ferns can usually be improved by putting them outside in a shady protected location once the weather gets warm. Water with rain water if possible and let them enjoy the fresh air."
24,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Angel Wing Begonia,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/angel-wing-begonia-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Angel wing begonia, first found growing in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of South America, is part of the Begoniaceae family. Many of the plants in this family have colorful flowers or beautifully patterned leaves and can be used as indoor houseplants, potted outdoor plants, or planted in the garden. Angel wing begonias make up a large portion of the cane begonia group. These unique plants have several nicknames such as: Angel Leaf Begonia, Spotted Begonia, Spotted Angel Wing Begonia, Angel Begonia, and Dragon Wing Begonia. The plant is a cross between the begonia aconitifolia and the begonia coccinea. All cane begonia plants have long stems with “joints” on them; the leaves and flowers grow out of these joints
Angel wing begonias are named for their large, “angel wing” shaped, dark green leaves that are often decorated with metallic or frosty silver specks. The underside of the leaf is usually a deep purple or red. These plants produce large, heavy, draping, clusters of delicate, dangling flowers in red, white, orange, or pink. The intensity of the flower and leaf colors depends upon how much light a begonia gets. When still a young, an indoor angel wing begonia is small enough to sit on a table or desk. As the plant matures, the stems can be pruned to create a large bushy floor plant or a beautiful hanging plant. If you have the room and the proper light, an angel wing begonia can grow into a 5ft tree.
Some new angel wing begonia cultivars that can bloom all year, have fragrant flowers, more spectacular looking leaves, and even a delicate scent
Begonia “Splash Splash” has splashes of white on the leaves and produces dark pink and magenta flowers.
Begonia “Charles Jaros” is a smaller, shorter angel wing begonia, growing to about 18″-20,” and produces pink flowers.
Begonia “Silver Wings” has silver spots on it angel wing shaped leaves.
Begonia “Looking Glass” has silver colored, rather than green leaves, with green veins and produces pink flowers.
Begonia “Anna Christine” is a large begonia that can grow as tall as 4ft and produces red flowers.
Begonia “Esther Albertine” is a tall, upright variety that produces large, hanging clusters of pink flowers. It’s wavy, ruffled leaves have silver spots.
Learning how to care for an angel wing begonia is not difficult but you can’t  neglect this plant as you might a dracaena or heart-leaf philodendron.
Provide bright indirect light
The soil should be barely moist, but be careful not to over water. Water less in winter.
When flowering, fertilize an angel wing begonia every other week with a liquid plant food high in phosphorus
Temperatures should stay above 55°F in winter
High humidity is a plus
Propagate using stem cuttings
An angel wing begonia plant is slightly poisonous to cats, dogs, and small children. Read more about common houseplants that are toxic in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants .
\
Angel wing begonias like bright indirect light but no direct sun. Proper light helps the leaves and flowers develop a more intense color. Insufficient light causes the plant to become leggy and prevents flowering. When light is too intense, the edges of the leaves curl and turn brown.
Be careful not to over-water! If the plant is in a small pot, allow the top 1” of soil to dry out before watering. In a larger pot, allow the top 2”-3” of soil to dry out. Angel wing begonia containers must have drip holes in the bottom for proper drainage and the plant should never sit in water. When over-watered, the leaves turn yellow and fall off.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when an angel wing begonia is actively growing with a liquid plant food high in potassium. Fertilize every other month during the rest of the year. To prevent leaf burn, feed begonias when the soil is damp and always dilute the food to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Angel wing begonias do well when the temperature is 65°-75°F (18.3°-23.9°C). Temperatures below 50°F (10.0°C) damage leaves and flowers.
Average household humidity is sufficient, Never mist a begonia plant; wet leaves encourage powdery mildew and leaf spot diseases.
Bright indirect light and a fertilizer high in potassium help an Angel wing begonia produce more flowers. Remove dead or fading flowers as soon as they appear.
Mealy bugs are the main pest that infects this plant. Do not use toxic pesticides on a begonia, they will damage the leaves. I recommend using the “green solution” (recipe is in the Glossary of the website) or a commercial insecticidal soap.
Yellow halos on the leaves are a sign of leaf spot disease, a plant bacteria that occurs when plant leaves stay wet or the soil is too soggy. As with all fungal and bacterial diseases, better air circulation, well-drained soil, dry leaves, and less water help control leaf spot disease. Never mist a plant if leaf spot disease is suspected. You can use a commercial fungicide or the or the homemade remedy of putting a tablespoon or two of baking soda and a teaspoon or two of mineral oil in a spray bottle of water. Shake the solution well and then spray all areas of the plant.
Angel Wing begonias like a rich soil that’s a little heavier than the soil used for other begonia plants. A heavy soil helps support the large root system and tall stems. I often use an African Violet mix.
Angel wing begonias like to be a little root-bound. Use a container with drip holes in the bottom that is an inch or two larger than the root ball. Select a heavy clay or ceramic pot that can support the plant as it gets taller.
Prune the older growth yearly during the winter or early spring. This prevents the plant from becoming leggy. New canes (stems) should be left alone. This is also a good time to re-pot your begonia if it has out-grown its existing container. Throughout the year, pinch off dead flowers as soon as they appear.
Stem cuttings are the easiest way to propagate an angel wing begonia. Cut a 3”-5” section from a non-flowering stem. The piece should have two to four nodes on it. Dip the cut end of the stem into a small amount of rooting hormone and plant it in a small container of perlite or sand. Plant about 3 stems per pot to have a bushy plant.
Angel Wing begonia plants have a #1 toxicity level due to the insoluble oxalates in the plant.
Angel Wing begonias need very bright indirect light in order to bloom. They also require quite a bit of plant food. Feed your Angel wing begonia monthly with a fertilizer high in potassium diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Increased light and food should encourage your begonia to bloom more.
The leaves on an Angel wing begonia usually turn yellow and fall off when the plant is over-watered. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry out before watering. Keep the leaves dry; yellow marks could be the start of Leaf Spot Disease.
Leaving your begonia hanging in an enclosed porch for the winter depends on how low the temperature gets. Angel wing begonias are easily damaged when temperatures go below 50°F (13°C). If the temperature on your porch stays this, you can leave your plant where it is; if not, you need to bring your begonia inside until the weather warms up.
Sounds like our angel wing begonia needs more humidity. I never recommend misting houseplants. I think that keeping the leaves of indoor plants wet encourages plant diseases such as leaf spot. To increase the humidity around a plant, set your begonia on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the begonia is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. You can also place a small humidifier in the room."
25,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Begonia Rex Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/begonia-rex-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Begonia Rex (Begonia rex-cultorum) is also called a Painted-Leaf Begonia, Fancy-Leaf Begonia, or King Begonia. This is a colorful, perennial, flowering plant that originally came from India. Today there are hundreds of hybrid varieties of the Begonia rex sold in stores throughout the world.
Most begonia plants are grown for their lovely flowers, though some have pretty leaves as well. A Begonia Rex, is grown for its large, colorful, patterned leaves rather than its small, pink and white “winter” flowers. The leaves come in a variety of shapes such as oval, spear-shaped, heart-shaped, and star-shaped. The leathery, ruffled, or puckered leaves can be as small as ½ inch or as large as 10”-12;” though the average leaf size is usually 4”- 6” wide and 5”-7” long. It’s the dramatic color combinations on the leaves that sets ta Begonia Rex apart from the usual green- leafed houseplant. Splashes, swirls, spots, and stripes of red, pink, silver, purple, bronze, green, yellow, orange decorate the leaves.
Some on my favorite Begonia Rex varieties are:
Begonia Metallica, is a bushy, upright begonia with metallic, dark green leaves and red veins.
Begonia Iron Cross, sometimes called a Begonia masoniana, has a distinctive dark burgundy, almost brown design in the center of it leaves that resembles a German iron cross.
Begonia “Tiger Paws” or “Eye Lash begonia” has white, eye lash looking hairs on the edge of chocolate colored leaves with bright green paw prints on them.
Begonia Cleopatra or Begonia Maphil has medium-sized, smooth, glistening, bronze leaves.
A Begonia Rex is a little difficult to care for especially if you are new to houseplants, but don’t give up. Here are a few things to keep in mind.
High humidity is a must to keep the beautiful leaves looking good.
A Begonia Rex needs bright indirect light most of the year and morning sun in the winter.
The leaves look faded when the plant is root-bound in a small or is sitting in too much direct sun.
A Begonia Rex likes to be warm at all times.
A Begonia Rex plant is a slightly poisonous plant and toxic to small children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants 
How much light does a Begonia rex need: A Begonia rex plant needs s great deal of bright, indirect light, but no direct sun during the spring, summer, and fall. During the winter, when the light is weaker, it likes a few hours of direct morning sun. If the stems of a Begonia rex become long and straggly, it means the plant is stretching for more light. The edges of the leaves turn brown when the plant is getting too much light. Since a Begonia rex does not bloom very often, it grows better in less light than some other begonia plants and can even grow under fluorescent lights.
How to water a Begonia rex: A begonia rex plant likes to be evenly watered, but hates to be over-watered. Wait to water until the top 30%-50% of the soil has dried out before you water. During the winter, when the plant is dormant, water even less. keep in mind the the soil at the bottom of the pot is always wetter than the soil at the top of the pot.
How to fertilize a Begonia rex: Start to feed a Begonia rex in the spring as soon as new growth appears. Fertilize every two weeks with a balanced plant food diluted to ¼ the recommended strength. Feed less in the fall and and not at all in the winter.
Best temperature for a Begonia rex: This is a plant that likes to be warm all of the time so be careful to avoid cold drafts in the winter. A Begonia rex can be damaged if the temperature goes below 60°F (15.6°C). The leaves can also be damaged by large temperature swings.
How much humidity does a Begonia rex plant need: This plant requires high humidity to grow well but avoid providing it be misting the plant. Misting can cause powdery mildew on the beautiful Begonia plant leaves. You can increase the humidity be grouping your plants together to create a mini greenhouse effect or by placing your Begonia rex on a wet, pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Does a Begonia rex flower: The small, pink or white flowers of a Begonia rex usually appear during the winter; they are quire inconsequential in comparison to the gorgeous plant leaves.
Begonia rex plant pests: Mealybugs can infest the area of a Begonia rex plant where the leaf joins the stem or the stem joins the rhizome. Use Neem Oil or a diluted insecticidal soap to treat the problem. Read more on how to identify and treat mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Begonia rex plant diseases: Because Begonia Rex plants like high humidity, they are especially prone to bacterial and fungal infections such as Botrytis Leaf Blight. Bottom leaves and stem sections are affected first with blackish, soggy, leasions. Treat the problem with a systemic fungicide; provide good air circulation around the plant; remove dead leaves immediately. When the soil is kept too wet, root rot develops and will kill the plant if not quickly taken care of.
Best soil for a Begonia rex plant: Use a loose, well-aerated soil that drains quickly for a Begonia rex. Using this type of soil prevents over- watering and root rot.
What size pot for a Begonia rex: A Begonia rex plant likes a large, relatively shallow pot so the rhizomes ( a modified, under the soil plant stem that sends out roots and shoots from the nodes on the rhizome) can easily spread out.
How to prune a Begonia rex: Aggressively prune a leggy Begonia rex to keep it bushy and full. Leggy stems are usually the result of insufficient light. Rotating a potted Begonia rex, whenever you water the plant, keeps the foliage growing in a balanced manner.
How to propagate a Begonia rex: A Begonia rex is propagated using stem and leaf cuttings. You can read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Does a Begonia rex need a resting period: A Begonia rex plant becomes dormant and rests in the winter months. During this time, reduce the amount of water you give the plant do not fertilize.
Is a Begonia rex a poisonous plant: A Begonia rex is a mildly poisonous plant with a #1 toxicity level. These plants are especially toxic to cats and dogs.
The vibrant colored leaves of a Begonia Rex start to fade and look bleached when it is getting too much direct sun. Do not put a Begonia where it gets a southern or even a western exposure. Move your Begonia Rex to an eastern exposure and the new leaves will be fine. There is nothing you can do for the old damaged leaves.
The best way to get powdery mildew off of your Begonia Rex is to remove the diseased leaves on the plant and any dead leaves in the soil. Spray the entire plant with a Fungicide, keep the leaves free of moisture, and provide good air circulation around the plant.
You can easily propagate a Begonia Rex from stem and leaf cuttings and also by dividing the rhizomes."
26,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Pygmy Date Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pygmy-date-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Dwarf Pygmy Date palm, Phoenix roebelenii, originated underneath the canopy of dense tropical forests in Africa and Asia. This helps explain why this plant does so well in the indirect light found in homes and offices. The Pygmy Date palm grows very slowly, reaching a maximum height indoors of  4-5 ft. (1-2 meters). This palm produces arching, graceful fronds about 3ft. or .9 meters in length with delicate leaflets on them. These fronds develop off of a stately central trunk. Like most palms, the Dwarf Date palm is an excellent clean air plant.
An indoor date palm does well in bright indirect light, but can survive in medium filtered light; be careful not to over-water in lower light. Place a Phoenix roebelenii near an east or south facing window.
Keep the soil of a Pygmy Date Palm moist but never soggy during most of the year. In winter, allow the soil to dry out before watering. The fronds of a Dwarf Date Palm turn brown from too much water or from hard water.
Fertilize a Phoenix Roebelenii once in spring and again in summer with a time-release fertilizer. Rose fertilizers work well because they provide important micronutrients that a Phoenix Roebelenii needs. Not enough magnesium in the plant food causes yellow spots on the fronds. If you use a regular, rather than a time release plant food, fertilize monthly when the palm is actively growing. Always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength.
The ideal temperature for Pygmy Date Palms is 50-75°F (16-24°C). A Phoenix Roebelenii does not do well when temperature go below 50°F (10°C).
A Phoenix Roebelenii needs moderate to high humidity.
Look out for Scale and Spider Mites on a Pygmy Date palm.
Root rot occurs when a Phoenix Roebelenii is over- watered.
Use a basic indoor potting soil that drains well. Add a little perlite or hard sand to potting soil to improve drainage.
Repot an immature Phoenix Roebelenii every few years in the Spring. A mature plant has very delicate roots that don’t like to be disturbed. As the Palm gets older, keep it in the same pot and replace the top few inches of soil each year. A Phoenix Roebelenii is a spreading plant that gets very top heavy so plant it in a heavy container so that won’t tip over.
There are sharp spines at the base of the leaflets on the fronds of a Phoenix Roebelenii, be sure to wear gloves when pruning off old fronds.
A Dwarf Palm is propagated using the suckers that develop around the base of the plant. Cut off the suckers, including their roots, and plant them in a small pot to start a new plant.
The Phoenix Roebelenii Palm remove benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and especially xylene from the air.
Phoenix Roebelenii are non-poisonous houseplants.
Yellow spots on Date Palm leaves appear when the plant is not getting enough magnesium from the plant food.
The fronds of a date palm turn brown when the plant is being over watered or if you are using hard water.
You have to bring your palm indoors if the temperature goes below 50 degrees."
27,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Selaginella Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/selaginella-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"There are about 700 varieties of a  Selaginella plant which are often referred to as Spike Moss or Arborvitae Ferns. Selaginella plants are very diverse in their size and in the manner in which  they grow.  Many types of a Selaginella plant can be found growing wild in tropical America, Asia, China, Japan, North America, Mexico, South Africa and Australia. A Selaginella plant, depending upon the variety, may be a creeping, climbing, or trailing plant. Selaginella kraussiana, which is also called Spreading Club Moss or Trailing Moss, grows about ½ inch high and has a limitless spread. S. kraussiana has very small bright green leaves that overlap on trailing jointed stems. Selanginella martensii is a small bushy plant that grows about 7-9” tall and just as wide. S. martensii has thick, multi-branched stems filled with small green leaves. When S. lepidophylla, a native of desert and semi-desert regions, doesn’t get enough water, the leaves roll into tight brown balls (a phenomenon known as cespitose) and the plant becomes totally dormant. Once this Selaginella  gets some moisture, the leaves open up, turn green, and the plant starts to grow again. This is why the  Selaginella lepidophyllagets is called the “Resurrection Plant.”  Keep an eye out for mealybugs and spider mites that can hide in the leaves.
Light requirements depend upon the variety of Selaginella. Bright indirect light indoors, partial shade outdoors is usually a good idea for most Selaginella varieties.
Keep the soil moist but never soggy and avoid using cold water. A Selaginella plant becomes totally dormant and the leaves roll into tight little brown balls when there is no moisture. Once the Selaginella is watered, it turns green and starts to grow again.
A Selaginella plant needs very little plant food. Feed twice a year, once in April and once in July, with a water soluble fertilizer diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Do not fertilize newly potted Selaginella plants for at least two months.
Best temperature 50°-75°F (10°-24°C ). Some types of Selaginella plants can handle temperatures as low as 40°F (4.4°C)
Spike Moss or Selaginella plants like high humidity.
Most frequent plant pests are mealy bugs and spider mites.
Use a peat moss based soil that retains water but still drains well for a Selaginella plant.
Pinch back the tips of the stems of a Selaginella plant if they grow too tall or leggy. Pruning stimulates new growth and helps the plant become bushier. Remove dead or damaged stems as soon as they appear.
In nature, a Selaginella plant is propagated by spores. At home or in the greenhouse, we usually propagate a Selaginella by plant division or stem cuttings.
Reduce water in the winter and protect a Selaginella from cold drafts and wind.
A Selaginella is a non-poisonous houseplant.
There are several reasons why leaf tips turn brown and dry so you’ll have to pick the one that might apply to your situation: Too much fertilizer, fertilize only twice a year and dilute the food to ½ the recommended strength. Too much or too little water. Lack of humidity, place the plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Too many chemicals in the water.
Limp leaves usually mean that the plant is sitting in a cold draught. Now that the weather has changed, is there cold air coming in the window?
I’d recommend Selaginella kraussiana, another name for it is variegated trailing Spike Moss. It looks great in a hanging basket.
Some types of Selginella look more like a moss but they are really more closely relayed to ferns. Both ferns and selaginella reproduce by spores rather than seeds like most plants.
I think you might have a selaginella variety called “Aurea.” It has yellow leaves."
28,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Philodendron Imperial Red,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/philodendron-imperial-red-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Philodendron plants have been growing in the tropical forests of America for centuries and have been a popular houseplant since Victorian times.  A philodendron Imperial Red, sometimes called a “Blushing Philodendron” or a “Red-leaf Philodendron,” is one of several hybrid philodendrons that have been developed by growers over the last few years. It is a member of the Araceae family of aroids. When small it is an excellent plant that can sit on a table or desk. As a philodendron “Imperial Red” matures and the leaves spread out laterally, it makes an impressive floor plant. This is an easy-care plant that can adapt to all kinds of conditions if you keep it warm.
There are two main types of philodendron plants, climbers and self-headers. The heart-leaf philodendron is an example of a small climber. Without  some form of support, the stems of a climber philodendron hang down. Many climbers produce aerial roots to help them cling to poles, wall, or large trees. The other main philodendron group is the self-header. The plants in this category are much larger than climbers and have much bigger leaves. A philodendron imperial red is an example of a self-header. It has glossy, wide, bright green and red, oval-shaped leaves spaced very close together on a single stem. This barely visible stem, which is usually only seen when the older, bottom leaves of the plant fall off, keeps a Philodendron Imperial Red upright and elegant looking. This plant, when grown indoors, can easily reach a height of 2-3ft and a leaf spread of 2-3 ft.  It has stiff stems that are strong and firm enough to keep the plant growing straight up as it matures.
Here are a few examples of other popular philodendron hybrids that are close relatives of the philodendron imperial red, have the same care requirements, and grow about the same size.
Philodendron “Imperial Green”  has smooth, shiny, green leaves that fan out in all directions, sometimes reaching out as far as 3ft (90cm).
Philodendron “Black Cardinal”  has wide, oval leaves that start out as burgundy and gradually become a blackish green or dark brown color.
Philodendron “Emerald Prince”  has glossy, green, elongated, oval leaves and grows 18”- 20” (45cm-50cm) tall and 36”- 40 “(90cm -100cm) wide.
Philodendron “Moonlight has bright, lemon/lime new leaves that turn a darker green as the plant matures. This plant may also produce large, pinkish, spathe like flowers even as a houseplant.
Philodendron “Red Emerald”  has deep, reddish/wine-colored stems, and long, elongated, heart shaped leaves.
Philodendron “Autumn” has large, copper-red, new leaves that turn a dark glossy green, with splashes of yellow as the plant matures.
 
            
P. Imperial Green               P. Autumn                      P. Midnight           P. Black Cardinal
Warm temperatures – minimum of 55°F (12.8°C) in winter
Fertilize only when the plant is actively growing
Avoid direct sun
These plants are poisonous and should be kept away from children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book: Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light does a Philodendron Imperial Red need: Although the plant survives in lower light, it grows faster and looks better when grown in medium light.
How to water a Philodendron Imperial Red: Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. The soil needs to dry out more during the winter when the plant is resting.
How to fertilize a Philodendron Imperial Red: Feed monthly when the plant is actively growing with a balanced plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. If a philodendron plant is not producing new leaves, it doesn’t need any plant food.
Best temperature for a Philodendron Imperial Red: Provide warm temperatures between 70°-85°F ( 21.1°-29.4°C). Keep the temperature above 55°F (12.8°C) during the winter.
Does a Philodendron Imperial Red need high humidity: Although the plant prefers high humidity, it still grows well in basic household humidity.
Philodendron Imperial Red plant pests: Keep an eye out for mealy bugs and aphids. You can read more about these plants pests and how to identify and treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Philodendron Imperial Red plant diseases: Erwinia Blight, a type of harmful plant bacteria, is the main disease that affects philodendron plants.
Best soil for a Philodendron Imperial Red: Use a rich, quick- draining soil. You may have to add a little sand to your usual potting mix if it appears too heavy and does not drain well.
What size pot for a Philodendron Imperial Red: Philodendrons like to be slightly root-bound and a little snug in their pots. When the roots have filled the existing pot, it’s time to move the plant to the next size container and nothing any larger. The pot must have drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape. The best time to re-pot a philodendron is in the late winter or early spring before its start to produce new leaves.
How to prune a Philodendron Imperial Red: This is a type of “self-heading” philodendron and rarely needs to be pruned. If the plant spreads out too far and you are running out of space, cut off some leaves at the base of their stem.
How to propagate a Philodendron Imperial Red: Professional plant growers use tissue cultures to propagate this plant and all of its hybrid cousins. In our home, we can try to propagate using plant off- shoots or air layering. Read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Is a Philodendron Imperial Red poisonous: All philodendron plants, including the Imperial Red, contain calcium oxalate are very toxic plants with a #2 toxicity level. Learn more about Poisonous Houseplant Toxicity Levels in the Glossary of the website.
Your Philodendron Imperial Red could probably survive in a dark corner for a little while, but it certainly wouldn’t thrive. I’d recommend putting it in medium or bright indirect light.
You are killing your Philodendron Imperial Red with kindness. The plant is losing leaves because the roots are staying wet and never being allowed to dry out. Start by allow the soil to totally dry out. Once that happens, water well and then do not water again until the top 50% of the soil has dried out. Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing with a balanced food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. If the plant is not producing new leaves, it doesn’t need any plant food.
As the leaves on a Philodendron Imperial Red mature they do become greener. Placing your plant in a brighter location will help maintain the red for a longer period of time."
29,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/3,Coffee Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/coffee-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The coffee plant or C.Arabica originated on the Arabian Peninsula and the mountains of Yemen. It’s also found in the highlands of Ethiopia and southeastern Sudan. In nature, the plant is a bush or small tree, much larger than the coffee plants we grow as houseplants. Coffea arabica is the first type of coffee plant that was cultivated, has been grown in Arabia for more than 1000 years, and is the one most of us drink today. Coffea canephora (“robusta”) has a stronger, more bitter taste. Coffea liberica, grown in Liberia, produces larger beans and has more caffeine than the arabica variety.
There are several varieties of the coffee plant that are grown outdoors; but the two types that grow well indoors are the Coffea Arabica and the Coffea Arabica “Nana.” Although the Arabica is a larger plant, it take several years for flowers to develops and for the plant to produce coffee beans. The Coffea “Nana” is a smaller plant, but produces flowers and coffee beans sooner.
A coffee plant has shiny, dark green, leaves with ruffled edges. Although coffee plants can grow as tall as 15ft. in nature, when grown indoors, with proper pruning, it is a very attractive, compact houseplant that rarely grows more than 4ft tall. An indoor coffee plant it produces small white flowers in the spring. After the flowers fade, the plant gets bright red berries that are about 1/2″ in size. These berries turn into blackish/green pods. The pods or “fruits” each contain two seeds which eventually become the beans we use to brew our coffee.
Keep a coffee plant out of cold drafts.
Provide bright, indirect light
Never allow the soil to totally dry out.
Propagate new plants from unroasted coffee beans and stem cuttings in the spring
It’s important to know that all parts of the plant, leaves, stems, bark, and berries are toxic to cats, dogs, small children, and even adults if a large amount is consumed. The attractive red berries are full of caffein which can be very harmful to dogs, cats, and small children.
Don’t expect to start picking beans for your morning coffee any time soon from your Coffee plant. It takes several years before the plant produces the fruit that contains a few seeds or beans that can be roasted and ground into coffee.
How much light for a coffee plant: A coffee plant needs bright, indirect light from an east or west facing window. Avoid putting the plant in the direct sun.
How to water a coffee plant: Water a coffee plant when the top 1″-2″ of soil has dried out. These plants are not drought resistant and can suffer permanent damage if the soil totally dries out. Leaves fall off if the plant is over or under watered.
How to fertilize a coffee plant: A coffee plant needs to be fed twice a year, once in March and again in late summer. Use a well balanced plant food (10-10-10) or fish emulsion
Besttemperature for a coffee plant: These plants prefer constant temperatures between 60°-75° F (18.3°-23.9°C), and can suffer damage if the temperature goes below 42°F (5.6°C) or above 78°F (25.6°C).
Humidity for a coffee plant: High humidity is essential so consider placing a small humidifier near the plant or setting it on a wet pebble tray.
Does a coffee plant flower: As the plant matures it produces small, white, fragrant blooms, followed by red berries. The red berries turn into pods that contain 2 seeds (beans). These are the beans that can be roasted and ground into coffee.
Coffee plant pests: Keep an eye out for spider mites, scale, mealy bugs, and whitefly. You can see a picture and read more about these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Coffee plant diseases: Since these plants require high humidity, they are susceptible to fungal diseases such as leaf spot and leaf rust. Read more about plant diseases the Glossary of the website.
Soil for a coffee plant: The best soil to use is a light weight, pours, acidic soil that also contains some peat moss or humus.
What size pot for a coffee plant: Repot about every two years in the spring is the roots of the plant have filled the current pot. Use the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape.
How to prune a coffee plant: Aggressively cut back straggly new growth to keep the plant short and bushy.
How to propagate a coffee plant: Propagate in the spring using fresh, unroasted beans. You can also use stem cuttings but the success rate is much less.
All parts of a coffee plant are toxic to dogs, cats, and small children. Ingesting any part of the plant can cause hyper-activity, diarrhea, and vomiting.
When you have a Coffee Plant as a houseplant you need to prune aggressively to maintain its bushy compact shape. Use a sharp scissors and cut the stems at a 45 degree angle about 1/4″-1/8″ above a leaf axil.
A couple of things could have happened. Your Coffee Plant may be getting too cold if a draft is coming in from the window. It may not be getting enough light now that the seasons have changed. You may be watering it too much. A Coffee Plant needs less water in the fall and winter than in the spring and summer.
Coffee plants usually get brown tips when there is not enough humidity in the air. You can place a small humidifier near the plant or you can put your Coffee Plant on a wet pebble tray. If you use the pebble tray be sure the plant is resting on the pebbles and not in the water. I don’t recommend misting since this increases the chance of fungal infections."
30,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Agave Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/agave-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The agave plant was originally found growing in Mexico, the southwest United States, and central South America. This is an impressive looking, succulent plant that grows well both indoors and outdoors. Because some varieties have spines on the edges of their leaves, many people have the misconception that an agave plant is a type of cactus; but it isn’t; it’s a member of the Asparagaceae family and is closely related to a lily and an amaryllis plant.
An agave plant comes in all different sizes and shapes; some are extremely  large and belong growing outside while the smaller varieties make perfect indoor potted houseplants. Agave plants are succulents with multi-layered rosettes of thick, fleshy, leaves. The short, thick stem is often hidden by the large, leathery leaves. If there are children and pets in the house, avoid purchasing agave plants that have sharp, pointed leaves with spiny margins. The sap in the agave leaves is very irritating and the spines and sharp points are painful if they puncture your skin. It takes many, many years for an agave plant to flower, especially when grown indoors. Some varieties may eventually produce a very tall stalk with clusters of flowers at the top. You may not want your agave plant to bloom since, strangely, they often die after flowering.
There are over 450 varieties of  agave plants. When selecting a plant for your home, choose one that will not outgrow your room.  Here are some of the most popular:
Agave attenuata (Foxtail Agave)
Agave Americana (Century plant)
Agave Queen Victoria
Agave Filifera
Agave Verschaffeltii
                                 
A. Filifera                          A. Verschaffeltii               A. marginata Americana          A. Foxtail
Indoor agave plants need very bright light and even some direct sun
Over watering is the easiest way to kill an agave plant
No need to mist just provide good air circulation around the plant
Do not rush to repot
Easily propagated using the offsets that grow around the base of the plant.
Yellow leaves mean the plant has been over watered and the roots are damaged
The sap of an agave plant causes skin irritations and the sharp, pointed tips and serrated edges on the leaves can cause painful sores.  Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to You Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants
How much light for an agave plant: An indoor agave plant needs all the bright light it can get to grow well indoors. Place the plant in front of a south or west facing window if possible.
How to water an agave plant: These are very drought resistant plants and the easiest way to kill an agave plant is by over watering, especially in the winter. During the spring and summer, water when the tops few inches of soil has dried out. In the fall, water every 2-3 weeks. During the winter, water about once a month.
How to fertilize an agave plant: When immature, an agave plant should be fed monthly, in the spring and summer, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not fertilize at all during the fall and winter. Once an agave plant is three or four years old, it doesn’t need to be fertilized at all.
Best temperature for an agave plant: Warm temperatures above 65° and as high as 80° are perfect for an agave plant. Avoid placing it near cold winter drafts or in front of an air conditioner.
Does an agave plant need high humidity: This drought resistance plant thrives in warm, dry air and suffers when it is too humid.
Does an agave plant flower: This plant may flower after many, many year. It will produce a tall spike with a cluster of flowers at the top. However, many times the plant dies right after it flowers.
Agave plant pests: Mealy bugs and scale can be a problem.
Agave plant diseases: The most serious problem is root rot caused by over watering. This fungal disease can quickly kill the plant. Immediatly get rid of the wet soil and allow the plant to sit out, bare root, for 24 hours. Repot in fresh dry soil.
Proper soil for an agave plant: Use a succulent potting soil or any good, loose, fast draining indoor potting mix.
What size pot for an agave plant: Use a shallow pot with drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape. The width of the container should be a few inches wider than the width of the plant. An agave is a slow growing plant and should not be moved to the next size pot, and nothing larger, until the roots of the plant have filled the existing pot.
Does an agave plant need pruning: The only time an agave plant needs to be pruned is if there are dead or dying leaves on the plant. When removing leaves, use a sharp, clean knife and cut the leaf off at the soil line. Be sure to wear a long sleeve shirt and use gloves. The sap of an agave plant is very irritating and the sharp leaf tips and serrated edges can be dangerous.
How to propagate an agave plant: The best way to propagate is by using the offsets that grow around the base of the plant. Offsets, or pups as they are often called, are the tiny plants that grow around the base of a plant. Wait until the offsets are several inches tall, then carefully detach them from the “mother”plant. The offsets should have a few roots by this time. Plant the offsets in a small pot, with drip holes in the bottom, of loose soil. Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy at all times.
An agave plant is a toxic plant and can be quite dangerous to have around dogs, cats, and small children. The leaves of the plant contain oxalate crystals, and if ingested, can cause swelling and difficulty breathing. Another problem is skin irritations caused when someone is pricked by the sharp leaf tips or the spines along the edges of the leaves. Dermatitis problems also occur if the sap of an agave plant gets into an open cut on your hands or arms.
Here are some general reasons why your agave plants may be dying: temperature is too hot or too cold, soil doesn’t drain quickly, over- watering, planting the agave too deep in the pot, not enough light.
The best way to propagate an agave plant is by offsets. After you remove the offsets from the “mother” plant, allow them to sit out for a few days before planting them. This allows the offset roots to dry out and prevents root rot from killing the new plants. Avoid planting the offsets too deep, this prevents stem rot. Indoor agave plants rarely produce offsets so this advice is primarily for outdoor agave plants.
The reddish orange sores on the leaves of your agave plant are caused by a plant fungus called Anthracnose. Keep the leaves dry, the humidity low, provide good air circulation, & cut off the diseased leaves so the fungus doesn’t spread to the rest of the plant.
I don’t think your agave plant has a disease. Your agave plant leaves became discolored because the plant was acclimated to indoor light so the intense sun & wind outside caused the problem. When you move a plant from inside to outside or vice versa, you should always do it gradually, increasing the time by a few hours each day."
31,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Dracaena Reflexa Song of India,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-reflexa-song-of-india-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"This hardy, decorative houseplant, formerly called a Pleomele reflexa, is native to Madigascar, Mauritius, and other islands of the Indian Ocean.  The Dracaena reflexa, Song of India, has yellow stripes on short, narrow, pointed green leaves that are spirally arranged on the stem and tufted at the branch ends. The usual Dracaena reflexa has solid green leaves. This is a slow growing plant that can be used as a table plant, bush, or short tree.
Dracaena plants are considered to be slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A Dracaena reflexa likes bright indirect light but no direct sun
Like all dracaenas, the reflexa likes to be kept on the dry side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. Over- watering, resulting in root rot, is the main reason this plant dies.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength. Do not feed in the fall and winter.
65°F (18.3°C) – 85°F (29.4°C). Temperatures below 55°F (12.8°C) can damage the leaves. Avoid cold drafts and heaters.
Does well in basic household humidity, but grows faster and leaves look better in higher humidity.
Scale, mealy bugs, spider mite: You can see a picture and read more about these insects in the Glossary of the of the website.
Dracaenas, especially when they are misted, may get fusarium leaf spot disease. This fungal infection causes water-soaked leaf spots on young leaves. As the spots become larger, they turn reddish-brown or tan and frequently have a yellow margin.
Use a loose, quick-draining soil to prevent over-watering and root rot. If your regular soil seems heavy, add some sand.
Dracaenas like being root-bound in small pots. Move your plant to the next size pot once the roots have filled the existing container.
Dracaenas are stalk plants so it is natural for bottom leaves to turn yellow and drop off as long as you are getting new growth at the top of the plant. Pruning plant tips helps the plant stay bushy and full.
Use 3′-5″ stem tip cuttings. Allow cuttings to sit out overnight before planting several in a small pot of loose soil; this allows the cut end to dry out and helps prevent root rot.
All dracaena plants help clean the air of harmful toxins.
A Dracaena reflexa is usually listed as a non-toxic plant, but cases have been reported of cats suffering tremors after eating some of the leaves.
The spots you describe sound like a disease called leaf spot. The first thing to do is keep the leaves totally dry and reduce the humidity around your reflexa. Then remove all diseased leaves and any dead plant material that may be lying on the soil. If the disease persists, you’ll need to spray the plant with Neem Oil or a Fungicide.
You can move it outside if you are careful about the weather conditions. Be careful not to let it get any direct sun. Direct sun will burn the leaves and ruin the plant’s appearance. Reflexas like to be very warm, so do not move them outside until the evening temperatures are not going below 65 degrees. Cold air and drafts really cause the plant to deteriorate.
Although some dracaenas, like the janet craig, can do well in low light; the dracaena reflexa, especially the variegated variety, really needs bright indirect light to look its best. You need to move your plant to a location where it will get better light if you want the leaves to look their best."
32,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Geranium Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/geranium-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A geranium plant is a very popular outdoor plant, but also makes a great indoor flowering plant. Geraniums are part of the genus Pelargonium which means “stork” in Latin. Native wildflowers and herbaceous perennials are the real members of the Geranium genus. There are over 200 Pelargonium species, most of them originating in South Africa. A Geranium plant produces clusters of flowers that come in a variety of colors such as white, pink, salmon, red, fuchsia, and lavender. Leaves are green, green and white, or multicolored. Geranium plants can be a compact upright plant or a graceful hanging vine. The vibrantly colored geranium flowers do not have an appealing aroma, but there are several geranium varieties that produce leaves with lovely scents such as rose, lime, peppermint, lemon, orange, or lime.  These plants are considered slightly poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me To Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. Geranium plants are a great addition to your houseplant plant collection, but very need very bright light or direct sun for at least 6-8 hours a day to bloom indoors.
Geranium plants grow indoors when placed in moderate light, but only bloom in very bright intense light. Fluorescent lights about 10 to 12 inches from a geranium plant can be used to supplement natural light
Geranium plants survive being under- watered but quickly develop root- rot when over- watered. Wait until the top 50% of the soil is dry, before watering.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. Geranium plants need food only when they are actively growing.
Geranium plants prefer cool temperatures between 65°-70° F (18.3° 21.1°C) during the day, and around 55°F (12.8°C) at night. Avoid placing a geranium plant in cold, drafty areas or hot, dry places.
Geranium plants grow well in normal household humidity. Very high humidity encourages bacterial and fungal infections; very low humidity encourages spider mites.
Geranium Plants need very bright intense light to bloom indoors. Immediately remove dead or faded flowers to encourage a Geranium to produce more flowers.
Aphids, whitefly, and spider mites can be a plant pest problem. If you put your Geranium outside for the summer, be careful caterpillars don’t munch on it.
Bacterial leaf spot, gray mold, blossom blight, or rust are plant diseases that attack geranium plants if the humidity is too high or if the soil or leaves stay wet.
Use a quick- draining, all- purpose, loose houseplant potting mixture that contains a fair amount of nutrients. If your geranium soil is heavy and clay-like, add some sand and compost to it.
As with all container plants, geraniums should be planted in pots with drainage holes. These plants like to be root-bound so don’t rush to re-pot them. When you move geraniums to a larger pot, use a container only one size larger than your existing pot.
Pruning a geranium plant helps keep it looking full. Cut back woody and leggy stems to keep the plant compact and bushy.
Geranium plants are easily propagated using stem cuttings in the spring.
Geranium plants are slightly poisonous with a level #1 toxicity.
There is a new plant called a Mosquito Geranium that has genes coded for citronella, which repels mosquitoes. The citronella smell of this geranium plant is released when the leaves are rubbed or crushed. Research is still being conducted to prove whether this particular geranium plant is really a mosquito repellant.
Spots on the leaves, dropping leaves, and soggy stems sounds like Bacterial Leaf Spot Disease. It is caused by warm humid air and poor air circulation around plants. Treat Bacterial Leaf Spot Disease by immediately removing any geranium plant leaves that have signs of the disease, keep the plant leaves and stems dry at all times, and place the geranium near a small fan to increase air circulation. If the Bacterial Leaf Spot Disease persists, try a copper Fungicide.
Geranium plants do not bloom indoors if they are not getting very bright light 6-8 hours a day. Move your plant to brighter light and see what happens.
Botrtis, a fungus infection caused by water getting on the geranium flowers, causes the center of the flowers to dry out. Botritis comes from poor air circulation, getting the flowers wet, or just over-watering a geranium."
33,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Easter Lily Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/easter-lily-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Easter Lily plant or Lilium longiflorum is a plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan and Taiwan and before the start of the Second World War all of our bulbs came from there. After 1941 commercial production of Easter Lily bulbs shifted to the United States. Ten farms situated along the California/Oregon coast today produce almost all the Easter Lily bulbs. The bulbs are picked in the fall and then shipped to greenhouses around the country. The commercial greenhouses plant them in pots and force them to bloom in time for Easter. The Easter Lily Plant is the fourth most popular potted flowering plant, behind the poinsettia, mum, and azalea. This is amazing when you realize that poinsettias are sold for around six weeks, mums & azaleas all year, and Easter Lily plants for only two weeks. Easter Lily plants produce a number of trumpet shaped, white, fragrant, outward facing flowers that are said to represent “purity, virtue, innocence, hope, and life. According to legend, Lilies grew where Jesus’ sweat fell to the ground during his final hours on the Cross. Churches are filled with Easter Lily Plants during Easter to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus. When buying an Easter Lily select a medium sized compact plant that has numerous dark green leaves down to the soil line and flowers in different stages of opening. There should be just one or two partially open blooms, and three or four plump unopened buds. That way you’ll have flowers opening and lasting for several days. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Easter Lily Plants need bright indirect light but no direct sun.
Water an Easter Lily Plant when the first inch or two of soil is dry. Be careful not to over water or to allow the Easter Lily Plant to sit in water. Many Easter Lily Plants come in a decorative wrap. Remove this wrap when watering so excess water can drain freely from the Easter Lily plant and allow the plant to air out before replacing the wrap. When buying an Easter Lily Plant, avoid plants that have soggy soil, since may indicate root rot.
It’s not necessary to fertilize an Easter Lily Plant while it is in bloom. However, once all of the blooms are gone, and you’ve placed the Easter Lily Plant in a sunny spot indoors or planted it outdoors, fertilize about every six weeks with a slow release plant food.
Easter Lilies prefer moderate to cool temperatures, 60-75 during the day and 55-65 at night. Like many other flowering plants, they do not do well in drafts or placed near fireplaces, heating vents, or appliances that give off heat.
As the fragrant flowers of an Easter Lily Plant develop, cut off the yellow anthers at the center of the flower. This helps the lilies last longer and prevents the pollen from ruining the lovely white blooms. Easter Lily will not re-bloom indoors.
If you decide to plant your Easter Lily outside after they finish blooming and all danger of frost has passed, use a quick draining rich organic soil.
An Easter Lily plant never needs to be repotted.
Immediately cut off the fading flowers to keep an Easter Lily plant looking good and growing.
Easter Lily Plants are propagated by bulb division.
The go-to plants to give at Easter.
All Lily Plants are poisonous, especially for cats. Cats become ill if they ingest any part of an Easter Lily.
Cut an Easter Lily Plant back to the soil level once the leaves have turned yellow. Cover the lily Plant Bulbs with mulch to protect them during the winter. In the spring, when the danger of frost has passed, remove the mulch so the new Easter Lily plant sprouts can grow.
You should plant Easter Lily Plant Bulbs about 6″ (15cm) deep and about a foot (30cm) apart. The soil for an Easter Lily Plant should be rich in organic material and be loose enough to drain easily.
Easter Lily Plant Bulbs don’t go dormant so you should never store them. Once the flowers of an Eater Lily Plant die, put your Easter Lily Plant in a bright location until all danger of frost has passed, then plant it outside."
34,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Moses in the Cradle Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/moses-in-the-cradle-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Moses in the Cradle plant grows beautifully both as an outdoor plant and as a colorful indoor plant. The scientific name of a Moses in the Cradle plant was originally Rhoeo discolour, then Rhoeo spathacea, and now it’s Tradescantia spathacea. It is the same family as the popular Wandering Jew plant and the spiderwort..  A Moses on the Cradle plant has several common names such as Oyster plant, Boat Lily, Moses-in-a-Boat, Cradle Lily, and Moses-in-the-Bullrushes. Whichever name you decide to call these colorful plants, native to Mexico, the West Indies, Guatemala, and Central America, they are easy to care for and grow well both as an outdoor plant in temperate climates and as a houseplant. The varieties sold as indoor plants are usually “dwarf” types and only reach a height of about 6”-12.” A Moses in the Cradle plant needs about 6-8 hours of bright, indirect light or it gets leggy. When that happens it’s a good time to aggressively prune the plant during the spring. You can use the stem cuttings to propagate a new Mosses in the Cradle plant.
A Moses in the Cradle plant is easily recognized by its rosettes of long, lance shaped, waxy leaves with vibrant, purple undersides. The leaves come out from the bottom of the plant, just above the ground. The most popular varieties sold have leaves that are green, or a mixture of green, white, and purple stripes. Other attractive Moses in the Cradle plant varieties are the “Golden Oyster” (Tradescantia spathacea ‘Sitara’s Gold) which has bright, golden yellow and green strappy leaves and the “Tricolor” (Tradescantia spathacea Tricolor) which has colorful pink, green, and cream variegated, strap-like leaves. A Moses in the Cradle plant is grown for its vibrantly colored leaves rather than its small, three petaled, white flowers. The flowers grow out of spathes that are “boat” or “cradle” shaped which is how the plant got its distinctive name.
Keep an eye out for spider mites, that could drain the color from the leaves, and mealy bugs that often hide inside the clumps of leaves. A Moses in the Cradle plant is considered poisonous and toxic to cats, dogs, and small children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.

A Moses in the Cradle plant needs very bright light. If the plant gets less than 6-8 hours a day of bright light, the stems become leggy.
Before watering a Moses in the Cradle plant, allow the top few inches of soil to dry out. Keep the soil drier during the winter months, when all houseplants, not just a Moses in the Cradle plant, are not actively growing.
A Moses in the Cradle plant needs to be fed monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. The plant does not require plant food during the autumn and winter.
The ideal temperature for a Moses in the Cradle plant is 60°-85° F (16°-19°C) during the day and about 10° cooler at night.
Moses in the Cradle plants prefer high humidity which is often not available in our homes, especially during the winter months. There are few things you can do to increase the humidity around your plants. Place a small humidifier nearby. Place your Moses in the Cradle plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Grouping plants together creates a mini greenhouse effect and increases the humidity. I’m not a fan of misting plants since is not that beneficial and often encourages pests and diseases.
A Moses in the Cradle plant produces small, three petaled, white flowers tucked inside purple, boat shaped spathes.
Spider mites and mealy bugs can infest a Moses in the Cradle plant, often hiding in the clumps of leaves where it is difficult to see them. You can see a picture of these insects and learn how to treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Because a Moses in the Cradle plant likes high humidity, root rot (caused by the plant roots staying wet too long) and leaf spot disease are a problem. Read more about leaf spot disease and how to identify and treat it in the Glossary of the website.
A Moses in the Cradle plant grows best in a loose potting soil that retains moisture yet drains quickly. This type of soil prevents the roots from saying wet too long and developing root rot.
A good time to repot a Moses in the Cradle plant is in the spring but only if the roots have filled the existing pot. When re-potting any houseplant, always use the next size pot and nothing larger. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape.
I recommend vigorously pruning a Moses in the Cradle plant during the spring to keep the plant looking full and bushy. Always wear gloves when pruning since the sap ion a Moses in the Cradle plant is toxic and very irritating. You can use the stem cuttings to propagate new plants.
A Moses in the Cradle plant is propagated by plant division or stem cuttings. Read more about these and other propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
A Moses in the Cradle plant is a poisonous plants with a #3 toxicity level. The sap can causes severe pain if it gets in the mouth or eyes and skin irritations. A Moses in the Cradle plant is toxic to cats, dogs, and small children so please keep this colorful plant out of reach.
There is a new variety of Moses in the Cradle plant called Rhoea discolor ‘Variegata.’ It’s a very spectacular looking plant with striped leaves in burgundy, pink, green and cream.
There could be several things going on. If your Moses in the Cradle plant is sitting in direct sun, the intense direct light may cause the color in the leaves to fade. If your plant is not getting enough indirect bright light the color may fade. The most serious cause would be an infestation of Spider Mites. You’ll need to spray all parts of the plant with the “ green solution” (1/2 alcohol, ½ water, a few squirts of biodegradable soap) There are complete care instructions in the Glossary on how to treat Spider Mites.
The ends of the leave of your Moses in the Cradle Plant are turning brown because there is not enough humidity in the air around the plant. You can put a small humidifier next to your plant or place itt on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on pebbles and not in the water. I don’t recommend misting these plants since wet leaves encourage fungal & bacterial diseases."
35,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Bleeding Heart Vine,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bleeding-heart-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Bleeding Heart plant, native to tropical west Africa, is grown for its masses of beautiful bi-colored flowers. Each flower on a Bleeding Heart plant is made up of a corolla or inner group of bright red petals that emerge from a white calyx or outer part of the flower. The Bleeding Heart plant’s nickname, the “Bag Plant” refers to the shape of the outer white petals. When planted in a container, a Bleeding Heart Plant can grow up to 3 feet in length, outside in tropical areas, it often reaches 15 feet. This lovely plant has twining stems with large attractive dark green leaves. You can place a trellis in your container to help a Bleeding Heart plant grow tall or place it in a hanging basket. A Bleeding Heart plant is a very poisonous plant and should be kept way from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants . The brighter the light the more flowers a Bleeding Heart plant produces.
A Bleeding Heart plant loves very bright light but no direct sun. The brighter the light, the more blossoms a Bleeding Heart Vine produces.
Keep the soil of a Bleeding Heart plant moist in the spring and summer but not soggy. When a Bleeding Heart plant is resting in the fall and winter, place it in a cool location and water infrequently. Never use ice cold water.
Feed every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength when the plant is actively growing.
A Bleeding Heart does well in regular household temperatures in the spring and summer, but likes cooler temperatures between 55°-60°F (12.8°C-15.6°C) when it is resting in the late fall and winter.
Bleeding Heart plants grow better when there is high humidity in the spring and summer and normal household humidity the rest of the year.
A Bleeding Heart plant usually flowers from March through October (spring through summer) when it is getting very bright light. The number of flowers gradually decreases as Fall approaches.
Bleeding Heart plants are seldom bothered by pests, but every once in a while Spider Mites and Mealy Bugs can be a problem.
Botrytis Blight is a plant disease that affects Bleeding Heart plants; but can be prevented by keeping the plant in an area with good air circulation from a fan or a window breeze.
Use a rich organic soil that drains quickly for a Bleeding Heart plant.
Re-pot every year, during the spring, to the next size pot and never anything larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot.
A Bleeding Heart plant has long, weak stems that need to be pruned back in the late fall after the plant has finished blooming. Pruning encourages the plant to become bushier. Since the beautiful flowers of a Bleeding Heart plant only develop on the new growth, it’s important to cut the plant back only after it blooms.
Propagate a Bleeding Heart plant from stem tip cuttings in the late spring or summer. Always use a sterile potting soil to prevent Botrytis and other fungal infections from developing. A Bleeding Heart plant can also be propagated by seeds in the early spring.
A Bleeding Heart plant goes dormant and rests during the winter; this helps it grow well during the rest of the year. From mid-November to mid-February, keep a Bleeding Heart plant in a cool room out of direct sunlight, water only when the soil is dry, and do not fertilize. The plant may lose some or most of its leaves during this period; but new leaves sprout from the roots of what appears to be dead wood in the spring, when you move the plant to a bright location.
Bleeding Heart Plants are poisonous houseplants with a level #3 toxicity. Quite a bit of the plant needs to be eaten before there is a serious problem. However, small children, small dogs, and other pets should be kept away from this plant.
A Bleeding Heart plant will grow well outside especially if you live where the temperature does not go below freezing in the winter. If the temperature does dip below freezing, the plant loses its leaves but will regrow from the roots in the spring.
I think you are watering your Bleeding Heart plant correctly and giving it enough light or it wouldn’t be growing well and producing new leaves. In order for a Bleeding HeartPlant to produce flowers you need to prune it back in the late fall after the plant has finished blooming. Since the flowers of a Bleeding Heart plant develop on the new growth, it’s important to cut the plant back after it blooms. Bleeding Heart Vines need to rest during the fall and winter in order to bloom. Lastly, check to see if the plant is root bound, if so move it to the next size pot. A Bleeding Heart Vine will not bloom if the roots are too crowded.
A Bleeding Heart plant is a poisonous plant, but caterpillars are the one little pest that seems immune to the toxin. In fact, if another animal eats a caterpillar after it has munched on a Bleeding Heart plant, that animal becomes ill. I have found that Neem Oil works well in getting rid of plant pests on a Bleeding Heart plant and does not harm the plant."
36,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Coffee Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/coffee-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The coffee plant or C.Arabica originated on the Arabian Peninsula and the mountains of Yemen. It’s also found in the highlands of Ethiopia and southeastern Sudan. In nature, the plant is a bush or small tree, much larger than the coffee plants we grow as houseplants. Coffea arabica is the first type of coffee plant that was cultivated, has been grown in Arabia for more than 1000 years, and is the one most of us drink today. Coffea canephora (“robusta”) has a stronger, more bitter taste. Coffea liberica, grown in Liberia, produces larger beans and has more caffeine than the arabica variety.
There are several varieties of the coffee plant that are grown outdoors; but the two types that grow well indoors are the Coffea Arabica and the Coffea Arabica “Nana.” Although the Arabica is a larger plant, it take several years for flowers to develops and for the plant to produce coffee beans. The Coffea “Nana” is a smaller plant, but produces flowers and coffee beans sooner.
A coffee plant has shiny, dark green, leaves with ruffled edges. Although coffee plants can grow as tall as 15ft. in nature, when grown indoors, with proper pruning, it is a very attractive, compact houseplant that rarely grows more than 4ft tall. An indoor coffee plant it produces small white flowers in the spring. After the flowers fade, the plant gets bright red berries that are about 1/2″ in size. These berries turn into blackish/green pods. The pods or “fruits” each contain two seeds which eventually become the beans we use to brew our coffee.
Keep a coffee plant out of cold drafts.
Provide bright, indirect light
Never allow the soil to totally dry out.
Propagate new plants from unroasted coffee beans and stem cuttings in the spring
It’s important to know that all parts of the plant, leaves, stems, bark, and berries are toxic to cats, dogs, small children, and even adults if a large amount is consumed. The attractive red berries are full of caffein which can be very harmful to dogs, cats, and small children.
Don’t expect to start picking beans for your morning coffee any time soon from your Coffee plant. It takes several years before the plant produces the fruit that contains a few seeds or beans that can be roasted and ground into coffee.
How much light for a coffee plant: A coffee plant needs bright, indirect light from an east or west facing window. Avoid putting the plant in the direct sun.
How to water a coffee plant: Water a coffee plant when the top 1″-2″ of soil has dried out. These plants are not drought resistant and can suffer permanent damage if the soil totally dries out. Leaves fall off if the plant is over or under watered.
How to fertilize a coffee plant: A coffee plant needs to be fed twice a year, once in March and again in late summer. Use a well balanced plant food (10-10-10) or fish emulsion
Besttemperature for a coffee plant: These plants prefer constant temperatures between 60°-75° F (18.3°-23.9°C), and can suffer damage if the temperature goes below 42°F (5.6°C) or above 78°F (25.6°C).
Humidity for a coffee plant: High humidity is essential so consider placing a small humidifier near the plant or setting it on a wet pebble tray.
Does a coffee plant flower: As the plant matures it produces small, white, fragrant blooms, followed by red berries. The red berries turn into pods that contain 2 seeds (beans). These are the beans that can be roasted and ground into coffee.
Coffee plant pests: Keep an eye out for spider mites, scale, mealy bugs, and whitefly. You can see a picture and read more about these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Coffee plant diseases: Since these plants require high humidity, they are susceptible to fungal diseases such as leaf spot and leaf rust. Read more about plant diseases the Glossary of the website.
Soil for a coffee plant: The best soil to use is a light weight, pours, acidic soil that also contains some peat moss or humus.
What size pot for a coffee plant: Repot about every two years in the spring is the roots of the plant have filled the current pot. Use the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape.
How to prune a coffee plant: Aggressively cut back straggly new growth to keep the plant short and bushy.
How to propagate a coffee plant: Propagate in the spring using fresh, unroasted beans. You can also use stem cuttings but the success rate is much less.
All parts of a coffee plant are toxic to dogs, cats, and small children. Ingesting any part of the plant can cause hyper-activity, diarrhea, and vomiting.
When you have a Coffee Plant as a houseplant you need to prune aggressively to maintain its bushy compact shape. Use a sharp scissors and cut the stems at a 45 degree angle about 1/4″-1/8″ above a leaf axil.
A couple of things could have happened. Your Coffee Plant may be getting too cold if a draft is coming in from the window. It may not be getting enough light now that the seasons have changed. You may be watering it too much. A Coffee Plant needs less water in the fall and winter than in the spring and summer.
Coffee plants usually get brown tips when there is not enough humidity in the air. You can place a small humidifier near the plant or you can put your Coffee Plant on a wet pebble tray. If you use the pebble tray be sure the plant is resting on the pebbles and not in the water. I don’t recommend misting since this increases the chance of fungal infections."
37,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,AFRICAN  VIOLET  PLANT,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/african-violet-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An African Violet plant, Saintpaulia ionantha, did originate in Tanzania and eastern Africa and its flowers do resemble violets, but they are are member of the Gesneriaceae family and are not in the same family as a regular violet plant. This extremely popular houseplant flowers many times during the year and is often given as a gift for birthdays or Mother’s Day.
An African Violet plant  is a small, compact, short plant with soft, furry, thick, round or oval shaped leaves. The leaves grow close together, in a tight group, on long stems, at the base of the plant. An African Violet plant produces beautiful, delicate flowers with five, velvety petals. The flowers can be white, yellow, blue, violet, pink, or fuchsia. Some of the newer varieties have large double, and bi-colored flowers.
There are many different African Violet plant varieties, and they come in all sizes and colors. Miniature African Violets can be as small as 3 inches. A semi-miniature African Violet is about 6-8 inches. The standard and large varieties start at about 8 inches and sometimes grow to be over 16 inches. Although African Violet plant leaves are usually dark green, many new hybrids have green and white patterned leaves. An African Violet plant produces beautiful, delicate flowers with five, velvety petals. The flowers can be white, yellow, blue, violet, pink, or fuchsia. Some of the newer varieties have large double, and bi-colored flowers. The trailing African Violet looks beautiful in a hanging basket. People always want to know how often do African Violets bloom? If you provide the proper amount of  light, know how often to water, and use the right fertilizer, these plants often flower throughout the year.
         
The plant doesn’t flower: Plant needs more light or humidity, exposure to cold air from doors and windows, pot is too large
Brown spots on leaves: Water, especially cold water, has gotten on the leaves
Yellow or pale brown spots on leaves: Sunburn due to being in the direct sun
Leaves Curling: Cold air and sometimes direct sun
Leaf edges turn brown and crispy: To much fertilizer
          
Brown Spots on Leaves      Yellow leaves                  Curling leaves
These plants are safe to have around children and are not poisonous to dogs and cats. With proper care, an African Violet plant can often live up to 50 years.  Follow the plant care tips below on light, water, fertilizer, humidity, pests, diseases, pruning, and propagation and you’ll have a wonderful, long lasting, flowering plant. If you want to give an African Violet plant as a gift, be sure to include instructions so your present can be well taken care of.
How much light for an African Violet plant: Provide an abundant amount of bright indirect light if you want to encourage flowers and leaf growth. A good location is close to an east-facing window. When the light is too low, the leaves on an African Violet plant turn dark green, lose their plump appearance, and the plant produces very few flowers. Leaves turn a pale yellow-green and flowers fade quickly when there is too much light.
How often should you water an African Violet plant: How you water is another important factor in helping an African Violet flower. Allow the top 1″- 2″ of soil dry out before watering. Avoid using water that has passed through a softener or water containing chlorine or fluorine. I like to water from the bottom since this helps prevent water getting on the leaves. Set your African Violet in a deep saucer of water for 10 minutes. Refill the water as it is absorbed through the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Remove any water that is still in the saucer after 10 minutes.
African Violet plant food: Special plant food is available wherever plants are sold. In a pinch, you can use any balanced, soluble, houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed an African Violet plant monthly when the plant is actively growing. Over-fertilizing can cause leaf tip burn, poor flower production, leaf cracks, and may even kill the plant.
Best temperature for an African Violet plant: Temperatures between 75°-80°F (23.9°-26.7C) during the day and about 10° cooler at night are ideal. Keep the plant away from cold drafts and heating vents.
How much humidity does an African Violet plant need: These plants prefers high humidity, but easily adapts to your normal household humidity.
How to get an African Violet plant to flower: The proper amount of light, water, and fertilizer are extremely important for an African Violet to flower. The right soil and pot size also help. A few flowering tips: quickly remove dead flowers and stems; keep the soil on the dry side; and keep the plant a bit root- bound.
African Violet plant pests: Pests that harm an African Violet are mainly spider mites and mealy bugs. Use a Qtip dipped in alcohol or Neem Oil to treat these insects as soon as they appear. The velvety leaves of these plants are easily damaged, so only use commercial insecticides that are recommended for African Violets.
African Violet plant diseases: The most common African Violet plant diseases are botrytis, powdery mildew, and erwinia blight. Preventing houseplants from getting diseases is much easier than treating diseases. Provide good air circulation and never get water on the leaves of your African violet plant.
Best soil for an African Violet plant: The soil should be a rich, airy, potting mixture. Special soil for African Violet plants is available at most garden centers. These plants benefit from some fresh, new soil every 6-12 months. Changing the soil prevents unwanted salts from fertilizers building up in the soil and burning the roots and leaves.
African Violet plant pot: An African Violet is usually sold in a small 4″ pot. If you keep the plant a little root-bound, you’ll notice that it will flower more often. When it’s time to move your African violet to a larger container, use the next size pot and nothing larger. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot. If the new container is too large, the soil stays wet too long, and the roots of the plant start to rot. Over- watering is one of the main reasons an African Violet plant dies.
How to prune an African Violet plant: Remove 2 – 4 leaves from the bottom of an African Violet plant each month to encourage new leaf development at the top of the plant. Quickly and carefully remove any dead flowers and their stalks as soon as they appear.
How to propagate an African Violet plant: It’s very easy to propagate an African Violet plant using leaf cuttings. The best time to propagate is during the spring; but you’ll need a little patience. It may take up to three months for the leaves you plant to develop roots and for new growth to develop. You can read more about how to propagate a plant using leaf cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
An African violet plant is a perfect gift for Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, and birthdays.
Is an African Violet plant poisonous: This is a non-poisonous plant and an African Violet plant is not toxic to cats, dogs, and is safe to have around small children.
The leaves of an African Violet plant crack and become brittle when the plant is getting too much plant food. When fertilizing an African Violet plant always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength and only feed the plant is actively growing. Keep the leaves of African Violet plant dry and out of direct sun; and use plain non-chlorinated water for better leaf growth.
An African Violet plant will bloom more often and produce more flowers when kept in a small pot and fed with the proper type of plant food. Other ways to help an African Violet plant produce more flowers is to move the plant to a brighter location and use distilled water that is free of chemicals such as chlorine.
The best way to propagate an African Violet plant is to take leaf cuttings from the plant during the spring. Remove a leaf, with its stem attached, dip the cut end of the stem in Rooting Hormone, and gently plant the African Violet plant cutting in a peat-based, quick-draining soil.
Keep an African Violet plant a little root-bound in a small pot; this encourages the plant to produce more flowers. When the roots have filled the existing container, move the plant to the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape."
38,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Pachira Aquatica,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pachira-aquatica-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Pachira aquatica was initially found growing in the wetlands and swamps in Central and South America. As an outdoor tree, it can be as tall as 50ft and produce both nuts and flowers; indoors it is much smaller and rarely produces either flowers or nut. A Pachira Aquatica first became popular as a houseplant in Taiwan during the 1980’s. The plant is often referred to as a Money Tree plant or Money Plant. The nickname Money Tree plant refers to an old story about a very poor man who prayed that somehow, he might be able get the money he needed very badly. Soon after praying, he found an unusual plant growing nearby and decided to take it home. When the plant produced seeds he planted them, grew more plants, and sold the plants to make the money he needed. So a Pachira Aquatica became known as a Money Tree plant. Other names for a Pachira Aquatica are Malabar Chestnut, French Peanut, and Saba Nut.
Today, a Money Tree plant is available throughout the world especially in bonsai form. A Pachira aquatica usually has a central trunk made up of three, five, or seven stems that are often braided together. Each leaf has 5-7 bright green, shiny, leathery leaflets.  When small, a Money Tree can be trained as a bonsai or used as a table plant. As the plant matures, it makes an impressive indoor tree  sometimes growing as tall as six feet or more.
Prefers high humidity
Medium to bright indirect light
Warm temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C)
Avoid cold drafts
Do not feed during the winter when the plant is resting
Best propagated in early spring and summer using plant cuttings
Other plants like a pothos and jade plant are sometimes referred to as Money Plants, but it’s the Pachira aquatica that’s used by the followers of Feng Shui. They believe that when placed in the right location in a home or business, a Pachira aquatica brings prosperity and good fortune.
A Money Tree plant grows best in medium to bright indirect light. This plant even does well under fluorescent lights.
Water well and then allow the top 1″- 2″ of soil to dry out before watering again. A Pachira aquatica requires less water during the winter months when resting. Be sure to use a container with bottom drip holes to prevent over- watering and root rot. It’s important to water the soil evenly.
Feed a Pachira aquatica monthly in the spring and summer, when it is producing new leaves. Try to use a plant food high in nitrogen during spring, balanced during the summer, and high in potassium during the fall. I recommend diluting your plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength. It’s not necessary to feed a Pachira aquatica during the winter.
This plant prefers temperatures between 65°-75°F (16°-24° C.)
A Pachira aquatica likes high humidity. If the air in your home or office is dry, place the plant on a wet pebble tray to increase the humidity. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Pests to look out for are: mealy bugs, scale, and aphids. Use the Green Solution (recipe in Glossary) diluted to 1/2 strength.
Be on the look out for Leaf spot, a fungal disease that causes leaf spots and other damage. The disease can be prevented by quickly removing any diseased leaves that fall off, watering well and then not watering again until the soil has dried out somewhat, and keeping the leaves dry. Commercial fungicide sprays usually help control the problem.
Use a quick draining potting soil. If the soil is too heavy, add sand to the mix to help it drain faster.
Keeping a Money Tree in a small pot controls its size and is essential when growing it as a bonsai plant. If you want a taller and larger plant, repot as soon as the roots have filled the existing container.
Cut off a few of the larger leaves from the bottom of a Money Tree plant each month to encourage new growth at the top. Pinch back the growing tips at the ends of branches to keep the plant small.
The easiest ways to propagate a Pachira aquatica are by stem cuttings and air layering.
Reduce the water and feed monthly while the plant is resting during the winter. Even though the plant is resting, you will still have to move it to a brighter location as the winter sun moves to different spots in your home.
A Money Tree plant is a popular house warming and new business gift since they are said to bring good luck and prosperity.
Money Tree plants are non-poisonous houseplants.
If the leaves falling off are yellow, too much water. Sadly it will also drop yellow leaves when the soil is very dry. If you are unsure about how wet the soil is at the bottom of the pot, you may want to get a water meter. You can read about water meters in the Glossary of the website. Temperatures that are too hot or too cold can cause leaf drop. A Pachira aquatica likes high humidity. Your Money tree can also lose leaves because of pests such as scale, mealybugs, and Aphids. Spray the plant with a mild solution of 8oz of warm water, mixed with a few tablespoons of rubbing alcohol, and a few tablespoons of liquid soap.
If new leaves on your Money Plant are coming in smaller, move your plant to a brighter location and fertilize a little more often.
Putting a Pachira Aquatica outside in warm weather is a great idea as long as you keep it out of the direct sun and remember to bring it indoors before nights get too cold. Putting this plant outside helps encourage new growth and may even help it to bloom.
Your Money Tree plant probably has scale. The sticky stuff excreted by scale is called honeydew. Spray your plant with the green solution recipe in the Glossary) diluted to 1/2 strength every 10 days for a month"
39,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/4,Spider Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/spider-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Spider plant, Chlorophytum comosum) is a member of the asparagus family (Asparagaceae) and is in the same family as the popular asparagus fern. First found growing in the subtropics of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the graceful spider plant grows well outdoors in warm areas and indoors with very little care. Chlorophytum comosum got its common name, Spider plant, because the small plantlets that grow on the long, hanging stems were thought to resemble a green and white spider.
The plant produces grassy-looking, narrow leaves about 8”-10” long and less than 1” wide directly from the center of the plant. When kept root-bound, a spider plant sends out numerous long runners (stems) that produce small, delicate, star- shaped, white flowers. Once the flowers die, baby plants (plantlets) develop and can be easily used for propagation. A spider plant can also be propagated by dividing the fleshy, tuberous, plant roots.
There are several varieties of spider plants available today:
Chlorophytum comosum has solid green leaves.
Chlorophytum comosum “Vittatum” is the most common spider plant. It has green leaves with a wide, cream colored or white stripe down the middle of each leaf. Even though this variety tends to grow more slowly than the solid green spider plant, it is the most popular variety sold.
Reverse Chlorophytum comosum “Vittatum,” has a green center stripe and white leaf edges. This is the second most popular variety sold.
Chlorophytum comosum ‘Bonnie’ (Curly spider plant) has the same leaf color as the Vittatum but the plant leaves are curly.
Chlorophytum laxum “Zebra” is like the ‘Reverse Variegatum’ spider plant but starts with yellow leaf edges that eventually turn white.
                              
Green Spider Plant      Variegatum Spider Plant      Curly Spider Plant     Spider Plant Flower
Be careful not to over water. Water less in winter when the plant is resting.
Wait until the roots have filled the pot before re-potting
Keep the plant in temperatures above 45°F. (7.4°C.)
Bright, indirect light but no direct sun
All spider plant varieties are easy to care for and fun to have. This popular, attractive plant grows quickly and produces graceful arching stems with small white flowers and and tiny plantletts in the spring and summer. A spider plant is inexpensive and a great choice for beginning plant lovers. An added plus, spider plants clean the air of harmful toxins. and are safe to have around children and pets. Read about other easy-care houseplants in my book Don’t Talk to Me I’ll Grow Better: A Guide to Easy Care Houseplants.
How much light for a spider plant: A spider plant likes medium to bright indirect light. Solid green plants need less light than green and white varieties. No spider plant should ever be put in the direct sun.
How to water spider plant: How you water is a very important part of how to care for a spider plant. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before you water. A good way to tell when the plant needs water is to look at the leaves. The green color starts to fade when the soil is dry. Using water with a high salt or chemical content (fluorine or chlorine) causes brown leaf tips. Never use water that had passed through a water softener; it is much too salty.
How to fertilize a spider plant: Feed monthly with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Spider plants need food only when they are actively growing. Over fertilizing can cause brown leaf tip burn.
Best temperature for a spider plant: These plants grows best when the temperature is between 65°- 75°F.  (18°-23° C. ). They will survive in temperatures as low as low as 45°F (7.4°C) without damage, but the plant will not grow very much.
Does a spider plant need high humidity: Spider plants prefer high humidity but still grow well in the basic humidity found in homes and offices.
Does a spider plant flower: A spider plant produces very small, white flowers at the ends of long, aerial runners (stems). These flowers are usually followed by “baby spider plants” that can be used for propagation.
Spider plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, scale, and aphids can all be a problem. Read more about each of these plant pests, and how to identify and treat them, in the Glossary of the website.
Spider plant diseases: Fairly disease resistant, the main problem is root rot due to over watering.
Best soil for a spider plant: Use a rich, organic plant soil such as an African violet mix.
What size pot for a spider plant: A spider plant likes to be root-bound in a small pot. Don’t worry about re-potting until the roots have filled the entire pot and the plant’s bulbous tubers have popped out of the soil. Small pots encourage more “babies.”
How to prune a spider plant: If the plant produces too many runners with “babies,” you can cut them off and use the cuttings to propagate new plants. Cut off any brown leaf tips due to too much fertilizer or chemicals in the water using a sharp, wet scissors.
How to propagate a spider plant: Using “plant offsets,” the baby plants that grow at the ends of the long runners and plant division are the best propagation techniques to use. Read complete details on the different ways to propagate houseplants in the Glossary of the website.
Does a spider plant clean the air plant: NASA lists a spider plant as an excellent plant for cleaning the air of harmful chemicals.
A spider plant is not toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets and is not poisonous to small children.
You can encourage a spider plant to produce “babies” or “plantlets” as the are called by reducing how often you feed the plant, keeping the plant root-bound, and moving your spider plant to a brighter location. Do not cut off all of the stems that the plant sends out. A spider Plant needs the stems to produce flowers which are followed by the baby spider plants.
The tiny brown bumps of the leaves of your spider plant are a plant pest called scale. Scrape the scale off the leaves using a child’s toothbrush. Spray the entire plant with the “ green solution” (recipe in the Glossary) or Neem Oil every 10 days for a month to prevent the scale from returning.
Too much fertilizer or using water that contains chemicals or salt causes the tips of the leaves of a spider plant to turn brown. Rinse the soil with distilled water to remove the excess chemicals and salts. Fertilize once a month with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength when your spider plant is actively growing. Never use water from a water softener; it is too salty.
Leaving a spider plant outside for the winter depends on where you live and how cold the temperatures get. Spider plants prefer temperatures between 60°F-80F° (15.6°C-26.7°C) though they can handle temperatures as low as 40°F ( 4.4°C) with minimal leaf damage.
Spider plants like to be very root- bound in small pots. I wouldn’t re-pot a until the rhizomes (tiny bulbs) are bursting out of the pot."
40,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Rose Bush Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/miniature-rose-bush-plant-how-to-grow-plant-care-tips/,,,"Miniature Rose bush plants, beautiful little hybrid plants that trace their parents back to China, usually appear in stores around Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. These indoor houseplant rose bushes  look lovely when first purchased but are difficult to keep indoors on a permanent basis. Enjoy your rose bush plant in your home and then plant it outside as soon as the weather permits. A miniature rose bush plant grows much better outdoors in the fresh air and bright light. This plant produces small 1”-2” (2.5-5cm) flowers in red, yellow, pink, white, peach, and orange. Since a miniature rose is a hybrid of the regular rose, it requires the same type of care and attention as a regular Rose Bush plant.
A miniature rose bush plant needs very bright light. If you don’t have a place in your home where the plant can get several hours of direct sun, move the rose bush outdoors into the sun for a few hours each day once the danger of a frost is over. When there is not enough light, rose bushes don’t bloom, the stems start to stretch to the light, and leaves are far apart.
A miniature rose bush requires a great deal of water, especially when it is flowering. Since these plants are usually purchased in small pots, be sure to check the soil every few days. Allow the top 1” (2.5cm) of soil to dry out before watering. During the winter, when a miniature rose bush plant is resting, keep the soil barely moist. Be careful not to get water on the leaves; wet leaves often cause a fungus called Black Spot to develop.
Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorous (5-10-5) at ½ the recommended strength.
Miniature rose bush plants do well in temperatures between 60°-75°F (16°-24°C). These plants are very susceptible to frost damage.
Moderate to high humidity helps the plant to grow well. If your home is dry, especially in the winter, place a miniature r bush plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Remove dead blooms as soon as they appear; this helps the plant bloom for a longer period of time. Always use a sharp pruner or scissors to cut off the flowers, never just pull them off with your fingers. Tearing the stems of a miniature rose bush, rather than cutting them at a 45° angle, damages the stem and encourages diseases. Once the plant finishes blooming and the weather warms up, move it outdoors, but be sure to bring it back inside once the temperature goes below freezing.
Spider mites and mealy bugs are two houseplant pests that can infest an indoor rose bush. Rinse the leaves once a week with a mild, soapy, water solution to help prevent infestations and keep the plant dust-free.
If the soil is kept too damp, miniature rose bush plants, like their bigger outdoor cousins, develop a fungal plant disease called black spot. Immediately remove the infected leaves and treat the plant with a fungicide recommended for black spot disease.
If there is more than one plant in your pot, remove the plants from the container, gently separate the roots of the two plants, and replant them into their own pots. Use as much of the original soil as possible and be sure all pots have proper drainage holes. When the pot of a miniature rose bush plant is too large, the plant doesn’t grow and root rot develops.
Remove dead branches and any other branches that may be rubbing against each other. Once the plant has finished blooming in the fall, prune the rose bush to encourage new growth during the next season.
You can propagate using stem tip cuttings in the early summer. Use a 4” (10cm) piece of a healthy stem, dip the cut end in rooting hormone, and plant it in a small pot of moist potting soil. Set the plant in a clear plastic bag to increase the humidity while it is rooting.
Miniature rose bush plants are non-poisonous plants.
The flowers buds on your miniature rose bush plant shrivel and die before opening because the air in your home is probably too dry. These plants really prefer high humidity. Place your plant on a tray of wet pebbles (be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water) or next to a humidifier to increase the humidity around it.
It sounds like your miniature rose bush plant needs much more very bright light. An indoor rose bush quickly deteriorates when it is not getting enough light. Miniature Rose plants like be planted outside in the sun as soon as the weather permits.
Your miniature rose bush plant has a plant fungus called black spot disease and washing the leaves just makes it worse. Remove the infected leaves, keep the rest of the leaves dry, decrease the humidity if possible, and spray your the plant with a Fungicide made for black spot disease.
Miniature rose bush plants get yellow leaves for any number of reasons: not enough water, not enough sun, or not enough humidity. Also, miniature rose bushes, like regular roses, become dormant for a few months and it is natural for them to lose their leaves during this period."
41,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Poinsettia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/poinsettia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Poinsettia plant (Euphorbia pulcherima),native to Mexico, is the most popular indoor flowering plant sold in the U.S. even though it is only available six weeks of the year. It has become a well-known symbol of the Christmas season. Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first US ambassador to Mexico, and a botanist, found poinsettias growing in Taxco, Mexico and had them sent back to his home in South Carolina.
The colorful parts of a Poinsettia plant are really modified leaves called bracts. Many people mistakenly think the bracts are the flower petals of the plant. These bracts are the beautiful part of the plant, but they are not the flowers. The real flowers are quite inconsequential and are located inside the small yellow part of the poinsettia called a cyathia. There is a cyathia in the center of each group of bracts. Selecting the right poinsettia is the key to having a plant that stays colorful and beautiful the entire holiday season. Ideally there should be green leaves all the way to the soil line. The plant should be well balanced and not top heavy. The “real” tiny, yellow flowers should be barely open, and there should be no pollen on the plant.
There are many different sizes and shapes of poinsettias available on the market today. Poinsettias can be found in 4’, 6,’ 8,’ 10” pots, and hanging baskets. The shape of a poinsettia plant can be straight up with be 3-4 stems each having one large poinsettia per stem. However, the most popular shape today is the pinched variety. The growing tips are pinched back which encourages a bushy plant with multiple flowers and side branches. Poinsettias are also available as large bushes, and topiaries. The original poinsettia was a bright vibrant red. Today poinsettias can be found in red, pink, white, salmon, Jingle Bells (red with pink splashes), Marble, Ice Punch (white center and deep red leaves), Marco Polo (light salmon with a touch of frost), and about 30 other speckled and marbled varieties. Whether you chose the ever-popular red poinsettia or any of the many new colors this is a wonderful holiday.
      
Poinsettias are photoperiodic plants which mean they start to develop blooms when days are short, and nights are long. A poinsettia needs 8-10 weeks of total darkness, 12-14 hours a day, during late October and November to produce flower buds and have their leaves (bracts) turn color around Christmas.
Late Spring/ Summer
The colorful leaves (bracts) on a poinsettia may last for several weeks or even months after the Christmas season. With bright light, proper watering side shoots will develop below the bracts. Once the side shoots develop and to have a nicely plant the following year, remove old flowers still on the plant in February or March. In early spring it is time to prune your poinsettia. Cut the stems back to 4″- 5″ above the soil line. Be sure to leave a few green leaves on each of the stems; new growth develops from buds found in the leaf axils along the stems. Keep your poinsettia in a bright, sunny, cool area where the temperature is between 60°–70°F (15.6°– 21.1°C) and fertilize once a month until December. Use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Between June and July, it is time to prune again. Cut all of the stems back to about 4” and be sure to leave a few leaves on each stem. Pruning is very important because it encourages the plant become full and bushy and produce more flowers during the Christmas season. Around August, pinch off the growing tips on the stems one more time.
Fall/ Early Winter
For the poinsettia bracts to turn color again, at the end of September you must move the plant to a place where it will be in complete darkness for 12-15 hours a day. Follow this routine until the leaves start to turn color in early December. The temperature should be between 60°- 70° F (15.6°- 21.1°C). Night temperatures above 70°F (21.1°C) may delay or prevent the plant from turning color. Hopefully you’ll have a beautiful plant in time for Christmas.
Poinsettias, despite all rumors, are not considered to be a poisonous plant. A pet or child would have to eat a large amount of the plant to become ill. A mild, itchy rash may develop if the milky sap of the plant gets on your skin. You can read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants .
       
Light for a poinsettia plant: A poinsettia plant needs very bright, indirect light but no direct sun from January to late September. The light from a north- facing window is not enough. If you put your poinsettia plant close to a window, be sure none of the leaves touch the glass or the cold will damage them. At the end of September, move your poinsettia to a location where it will be in total darkness for 12-15 hours a day. Keep the plant in this location until the leaves begin to to turn color in December. The light from a north- facing window is not enough. If you put your poinsettia plant close to a window, be sure none of the leaves touch the glass or the cold will damage them.
How to water a poinsettia plant: A poinsettia plant is a member of the Euphorbia family and like been theory side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before you water to prevent root rot. Over-watering a poinsettia causes green leaves to fall off, leaving bare stems topped by a few colorful bracts. Severe under-watering, in which a poinsettia plant badly droops, results in both green and colored leaves dropping off. Avoid getting the leaves of a poinsettia plant wet when watering; water drops cause unsightly white marks on the flowers and leaves.
How to fertilize a poinsettia plant: Feed a poinsettia monthly from late February until December. Use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a poinsettia plant: Temperature is a very important factor in poinsettia plant care. A poinsettia plants lasts longer and look better when the temperature is between 65°-70°F (18.3°-21.1°C) during the day and around 60°F (15.6°C) at night. Temperatures that are too hot or too cold damage leaves and may cause leaf drop. Keep a poinsettia plant away from drafty doors and windows, fireplaces, heaters, and the tops of appliances that give off heat.
How much humidity for a poinsettia plant: A poinsettia plant does well in basic household humidity.
How to get a poinsettia to flower again: Please see completer instructions below.
Poinsettia plant pests: Plant pests that can be problem for a poinsettia plant are: whiteflies, fungus gnats, mealy bugs, and spider mites. Read how to identify and treat these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
Poinsettia plant diseases: Avoid over- watering and keep the leaves of a poinsettia plant dry to prevent plant diseases.
Proper soil for a poinsettia plant: Use a high quality, sterile, quick-draining, acidic potting soil for a poinsettia plant.
Best pot sizer a poinsettia plant: Poinsettia plants can be found in 4″-14″pots. The container should only be 2″-4″ larger than the root ball of the plant and must have drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape. Never allow the plant to sit in the excess water for more than 10 minutes. If the pot is too large, the soil stays wet too long, and the plant develops root rot.
How to propagate a poinsettia: A poinsettia is propagated using 3″-4″stem cuttings from healthy new growth. Do not use old stems that have flowered the previous year for propagation. The cuttings should have several matures leaves on them. You can read a complete guide on how to propagate a plant using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
A poinsettia plant is a perfect Christmas gift.
A poinsettia plant is not toxic to small children, cats, or dogs. Despite all the rumors, the plant causes minor discomfort if a few leaves are eaten. If quite a bit of the plant is ingested, some vomiting, drooling in pets, or sometimes diarrhea may be occur. It’s the white, milky sap of a poinsettia plant that can cause redness, swelling, and itchiness if it gets on the skin, especially if someone is allergic to latex.
Poinsettias come in many colors, red, white, pink, salmon, marble, red & white mix, speckled, but not blue & purple. Poinsettias that are blue and purple have been spray painted with floral paint to get the desired color or injected with a blue dye.
Poinsettia Plants lose both green leaves and colorful bracts if the soil is too wet. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering a Poinsettia Plant. Poinsettias should never totally dry out, but over- watering a Poinsettia Plant is worse than under- watering a Poinsettia Plant.
Sitting Poinsettia Plants in water is a bad idea. I would either move your Poinsettias to a new location where it is easier to water them or use a product called DriWater, a sausage like tube of gel that you cut open and lay on the wet soil. DriWater slowly provides moisture to the plant for several weeks. You can read more about Dri-Water in the Glossary of the website.
The little plant pests flying around your Poinsettia Plant are white flies. I don’t recommend spraying anything on the leaves of a Poinsettia Plant since they are so easily damaged. Place some Yellow Sticky Insect Cards on top of the soil in the plant. Keep replacing the insect cards as they get covered with the White Flies. I’d leave an insect card in the plant permanently to prevent more White Flies.
The leaves of your Poinsettia Plant are turning black because they are touching the window and being damaged by the cold. The bright light is perfect for a Poinsettia, but you have to move your plant away from all drafts, heaters, and anything hot or cold that might touch the leaves."
42,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Bougainvillea Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bougainvillea-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A bougainvillea plant is native to the rain forests of Brazil, Peru, and southern Argentina. Bougainvillea plants, with their thorny, woody, tropical vines, produce beautiful clusters of red, pink, orange, white, yellow, purple, and magenta paper-like bracts. The colorful bracts surround the actual flower, which is usually small and white. Bougainvillea flowers appear on branches 18″-20″ long. A Bougainvillie is a very poisonous plant and should be kept way from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants Once used primarily as an outdoor plant, a Bougainvillea is now commonly used as spectacular looking indoor plant.
A Bougainvillea Plant needs bright full sun for at least 5-6 hours every day in order to bloom. Lack of light is the main reason why a Bougainvillea Plant doesn’t flower indoors. Keep a Bougainvillea These plants need at least 5 hours of sun to grow and flower indoors. Place as close to a south or west facing window as possible.
Bougainvillea is a drought tolerant plant that should be kept on the dry side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. A bougainvillea may even wilt a little to let you know it needs water. When you do water a bougainvillea plant, water deeply and cover the entire surface of the soil. Good drainage is essential and a bougainvillea should never sit in water. Frequent light waterings encourages weak roots and discourages good flower color. During the winter, a bougainvillea requires even less water. If over-watered bougainvillea plants develop root rot, do not flower, and drop leaves. If the soil totally dries out, bracts and leaves fall off.
Fertilize monthly when the plant is in bloom with a special bougainvillea or hibiscus plant food high in iron and micronutrients. This type of plant food helps strengthen the thin delicate roots and increases the number of blooms. When a bougainvillea plant is resting or not producing flowers during the winter months, fertilize every other month, diluting the plant food to ½ the recommended strength. Never fertilize if the soil is very dry or it will burn the roots.
A bougainvillea does well in temperatures between 70°-85°F during the day and 60°-70°F at night. When resting during the winter, Bougainvilleas prefer temperatures between 50°-60°F.
Bougainvilleas likes high humidity, especially when it is about to bloom. During the winter, when it’s resting, A Bougainvillea Plant requires less humidity.
Bougainvillea Plants, like Peace Lilies and Lipstick Plants, produce more flowers when stressed. Keeping a Bougainvillea root-bound and on the dry side encourages it to bloom. Bougainvillea Plants will not bloom if they don’t get 5-6 hours of bright sun each day.
A Bougainvillea is a very pest resistant plant. On rare occasions, aphids may be a problem for a Bougainvillea, or caterpillars may infest the plant if you put it outside during the summer.
Leaf Spot disease can occur because of the high humidity a Bougainvillea needs. Keep the leaves of a Bougainvillea Plant dry to help prevent Leaf Spot disease and use a fungicide to control Leaf Spot disease ifit occurs.
Bougainvillea Plants need a loamy soil with a great deal of organic material in it. It’s important for the soil to drain quickly to prevent root rot.
Bougainvillea Plants grow well in large hanging baskets at least 10″-12″ in size or in 5-10 gallon clay planters. I recommend clay planters because they allow the soil to dry out faster. Bougainvilleas flower more often when they are root-bound.
Prune a Bougainvillea plant to maintain its shape and size. It’s perfectly fine to remove entire branches or limbs to get a bougainvillea to fit a particular area.
Propagate a Bougainvillea Plant using stem cuttings.
During the winter, when a Bougainvillea Plant is resting, cut back on water and plant food and place your Bougainvillea in lower light and cooler temperatures.
A Bougainvillea Plant is a very poisonous houseplant and has a #3 Toxicity Level. The sap from a Bougainvillea can cause a rash that resembles poison ivy so be sure to wear gloves when pruning this plant.
Reddish- brown spots on the leaves of a Bougainvillea Plant usually indicate a fungus infection like Leaf Spot Disease. Fungal plant diseases are caused by high humidity or water staying on the leaves of a Bougainvillea Plant. Cutting off the diseased leaves, providing good air circulation around your Bougainvillea plant, keeping the leaves dry, and using a Fungicide are the best ways to treat a fungal plant disease.
Incorrect watering is why a Bougainvillea Plant loses leaves and never gets flowers. Allow at least the top 35% of the soil to dry out before watering a Bougainvillea or even wait until the leaves start to droop. Allowing the soil of a Bougainvillea to dry out helps the plant bloom. When you water a Bougainvillea Plant, water well enough so that the water drains out the bottom drip holes. Frequent light waterings only encourage a weak root system.
A Bougainvillea Plant needs the following things in order to bloom: 5-6 hours of direct sun; rich fertile soil that is kept on the dry side; plant food made especially for Bougainvillea or Hibiscus Plants, aggressive pruning every year, pots that are large but still small enough to allow the Bougainvillea Plant to become root- bound.
Drooping leaves on a Bougainvillea Plant when the soil is wet is an indication of root rot due to over-watering.
A light frost shouldn’t kill a Bougainvillea Plant, but most of the leaves and colorful bracts will probably fall off. A Bougainvillea should start to grow again if you move it inside and keep the temperature above 50 degrees."
43,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Stromanthe Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/stromanthe-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Stromanthe sanguinea “Tricolor” (sometimes referred to a Stromanthe “Triostar”) is native to the rain forests of Brazil where the plant grows as tall as 5ft (1.5m) and as wide as 3′ (.9m) and has leaves 20” (50cm) long and 6” (15.2 cm) wide. The Stromanthe is a close relative of the Prayer plant and the Ctenanthe and is a member of the Marantaceae family. Although a Stromanthe plant can be grown indoors or outdoors, it won’t survive a freeze and prefers temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C). Like a Prayer plant, the leaves of a Stromanthe fold up at night as though praying. and open the next morning.
As a houseplant, the upright Stromanthe is usually about 2′-3′ (.6m -.9m) tall and produces long, elliptical-shaped, multi-colored, glossy leaves about 6″-12″ (15.2cm -30.5cm) long. The topside of the leaves are a combination of green, cream, white, and pink. No matter what the variety, the underside of the leaves is always a vibrant pinkish-red- color. The leaves of a Stromanthe lean in the direction of the light source as it moves across a room throughout the day. Once night arrives and it’s dark, the leaves fold up and open again as the light returns the next morning. When grown indoors, a Stromanthe may produce tiny white flowers surrounded by bright red bracts during late winter or early spring. The flowers are only about ½” (1.2cm) but the bracts surrounding them can be  2”-3” (5cm-7.5cm) wide. The flowers can’t compete with the plants’ beautiful leaves.
Tricolor Stromanthe (Stromanthe sanguinea) is the most popular variety sold. The top side of the oval – shaped leaf is a mixture of patches of dark and light green, cream, white, and pink. The underside of the leaf is a vibrant shade of pinkish  burgundy.
Stromanthe Magic Star has leaves that are narrower and less colorful that the Tricolor Stromanthe. The topside of the leaf is bright green with streaks and dots of white and cream. The underside of the leaf is a deep red.
Stromanthe amabilis has greenish-grey leaves with dark green streaks
Stromanthe “Charlie” has medium green leaves with wide and narrow streaks of dark green and white.
Green Stromanthe (Stromanthe sanguinea “Green”) is just green, the leaves have no other colors. The leaves do have a nice shine to them and a large light green middle rib.
Bright, indirect light
Keep soil barely moist but never allow the plant to sit in water
Feed every two weeks from May to September
Grows best in high humidity and warm temoeratures
Propagate by plant division
A Stromanthe plant is a spectacular looking plant, but challenging to grow, definitely not for beginners. It is a non-poisonous plant and safe to have around dogs, cats, and small children.
Place a Stromanthe plant in bright indirect light but no direct sun; a north or east facing window is best.
A Stromanthe likes to be kept barely moist at all times. Be careful not to over-water or the roots rot and the plant dies. In winter, allow the soil of a Stromanthe to dry out a little more, but never completely.
Feed every two weeks when the plant is actively growing, this is usually from early spring to the end of fall. Use a balanced fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Stromanthe plants prefer warm temperatures between 65°F and 80°F (18.3°C-26.7°C) during the day and 5° cooler at night. Avoid cold or hot drafts.
A Stromanthe needs high humidity to keep its beautiful leaves looking good. If your house is dry, place a Stromanthe on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Stromanthe plant leaves turn brown and become crisp when the air is too dry.
A Stromanthe “sanquinea” produces reddish-orange flowers in the spring.
Aphids and spider mites can be a pest problem. (read more about these pests in the Glossary of the website)
The high humidity a Stromanthe plant requires encourages fungal plant diseases.
Use a light, quick-draining soil that retains moisture but still drains quickly. A peat-based potting soil is a good choice for a Stromanthe.
Repot in late spring or summer. Be sure a Stromanthe has outgrown its existing pot before moving it to a larger one. When changing pots, use the next size container and nothing larger and be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot.
Remove damaged or unattractive leaves where they are attached to the main stem.
Stromanthe plants are propagated by plant division. Carefully separate a Stromanthe rhizome, with 2 or 3 leaves attached, from the main root ball and plant it in a small pot of moist potting soil. Propagate in the spring before the plant starts its growth spurt.
A Stromanthe is considered to be a non-toxic plant and safe to have around pets and small children.
A Stromanthe would love to spend the summer on your porch, but be sure it’s in the shade and not getting any direct sun. Bring it back inside before there is a chance of a hard frost.
The humidity loving Stromanthe will thrive in a terrarium. The only problem may be that is will get too large. These plants can get to be 2-3 feet in the right conditions.
I think you have a couple of things going on. First of all, a Stromanthe should never get direct sun, it causes the color in the leaves to fade. bright indirect light from a north or east facing window is best. Another think Stromanthes don’t like is being in a draft. I’d move it off the window sill incase there is some cold air coming in at night."
44,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Polka Dot Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/polka-dot-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"If you’re looking for a small, brightly colored, cheery plant, a polka dot plant is the right one for you. A polka dot plant (Hypoestes phyllostachya), also called a Pink Splash plant, is a beautiful plant native to Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and South Africa. When planted outdoors, a polka dot plant can grow as tall as 12” (30c) and become a short, bushy shrub. It is usually grown as an annual in warm, temperate regions.
Indoors, as a houseplant, a polka dot plant usually comes in a 4″ or a 6″ pot and looks beautiful in dish gardens or in small, decorative containers. The oval, pointed, delicate, green leaves are covered in spots and splashes of red, rose, white, or light green which give the plant its nicknames – Pink Splash, Red Splash, or White Splash. Some new varieties of the polka dot plant have pink leaves with green patches. The brighter the light, the more vivid the colors in the leaves; but avoid putting the plant in direct afternoon sun. Other nicknames for a polka dot plant are Freckle Face plant, Measles plant, and Flamingo plant. A polka dot plant is a close relative of the Fittonia plant (Mosaic plant or Nerve plant), another houseplant with beautifully patterned leaves.
Polka dot plants need to be aggressively pruned and the growing tips frequently pinched; otherwise, the plant becomes thin and leggy looking. You can use the stem cuttings to propagate a new plant. Polka dot plants sometimes flower during the summer months. The small pale purple or pink flowers are insignificant in comparison to the brightly colored plant leaves. The flowers tend to slow down plant growth, so I recommend removing the blooms and their stems as soon as they appear.
A polka dot plant is not a poisonous plant and is not toxic to cats, dogs, or children. However, the attractive leaves are a temptation and often end up in mouths where they don’t belong. If possible, try to keep a polka dot plant out of reach.
A polka dot plant, Hypoestes, grows best in bright, indirect light. Too much light or too little light causes the colors in the beautiful leaves to fade.
Water a polka dot plant well and then allow the top 25% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Over-watering causes root rot. If the soil gets too dry and the leaves droop, a polka dot plant quickly perks up once it’s watered.
Feed a polka dot plant monthly in the spring and summers with a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. During the fall and winter, fertilize every other month.
Warm temperatures around 75°F (23.9°C) are necessary for a polk dot plant to thrive indoors.
Polka dot plants grow faster in high humidity, but are still happy in basic household humidity.
The flowers of a polka dot plant appear during the summer and are small and inconsequential compared to the bright, bold leaves. I recommend that you remove the flowers as soon as they appear so they don’t slow down leaf development.
The colorful leaves of a polka dot plant attract several plant pests: whiteflies, aphids, and mealy bugs. Use the “green solution”(recipe in the Glossary) diluted to ½ strength to get rid of these plant pests. You can also see a picture of each of and learn how to identify plant pests in the Glossary.
Over- watering a polka dot plant causes root rot. Poor air circulation and wet plant laves encourages powdery mildew. Read how to identify and treat powdery mildew in the Glossary of the website.
The best soil for a polka dot plant is a rich, loose, peat-based soil that drains well.
Polka dots plants are usually found in 4″ and 6″ pots. They have a very small root system and very rarely need a container larger than 6″.
It’s very important to aggressively prune a polka dot plant to prevent it from becoming leggy and thin looking. Pinching off the growing tips at the ends of the stems helps keep a polka dot plant bushy.
Polka dot plants usually have a limited life span; and the foliage often becomes leggy and the stems bare looking. You can easily start a whole new plant using stem tip cuttings. Read more about how to propagate a plant using stem tip cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
A polka dot plant is a non-poisonous houseplant and safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
It sounds like you have over- watered your polka dot plant, and the plant has developed root rot. You can try cutting the plant all the way back, placing the plant in bright, indirect light, and letting the soil dry out thoroughly; a few roots may still be alive.
Sounds like your polka dot plant has whiteflies. Get some yellow sticky cards (you can read about these in the Glossary of the website) at your local plant shop or home improvement store. Put a small piece in each of your plants. The card will catch the adult insects that are flying around. Also, spray your plant with the ” green solution” at 1/2 strength to get the nymphs that are feeding on the leaves.
Your polka dot plants getting too much light and it’s causing the leaf color to fade. Move the plant than area with less light and the new leaves should be brightly covered again.
Thin and straggly polka dot plants should be pruned aggressively and placed in a bright area. Once new leaves start to appear, feed the plant monthly with a balanced plant food."
45,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Orchid – Cymbidium Orchid Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/cymbidium-orchid-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Cymbidium Orchid plant, or Boat orchid, is among the most attractive, popular, and long lasting orchid plants available throughout the world.  The name Cymbidium comes from the greek word Kumbos which means cavity and refers to the shape of the base of the lip of the flower. Cymbidium orchids  have been cultivated for thousands of years in Eastern Asia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Borneo, northern Australia, and the Himalayas but only became popular in Europe during the Victorian Age. Today, because of the many hybrid Cymbidium orchid plants, they grow throughout the world. These plants have long, thin, grass – like leaves. Sturdy stems or spikes emerge from the leaves of the plant and each spike produces 15-30 beautiful waxy- looking orchid flowers. There are over 52 varieties of Cymbidiums, each with a different color and pattern to their flowers. Cymbidium blooms, which often last for months, come in yellow, red, pink, orange, light green, yellowish green, white, cream, and even brown. The only flower colors missing are blue and black. These plants have the added advantage of being able to bloom during the winter when other orchids cannot. Although Cymbidium orchid plants require a little extra care (as do Phaleonopsis Orchid plants) and prefer a special soil, their beautiful flowers make it all worthwhile.
Cymbidium orchids like as much bright, indirect light as you can provide; but avoid placing them in the direct sun. Light green upright leaves indicate that your orchid plant is getting the proper amount of light. Dark green leaves mean a Cymbidium orchid needs more light. Yellow leaves are an indication that they are getting too much light.
The easiest way to kill Cymbidium orchid plants is by over-watering. When watering, thoroughly drench the plant, then let the excess water drain out the bottom drip holes. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. You can prevent over and under-watering by checking the roots, they should be whitish- green and plump. Follow these few watering tips to prevent watering problems. Never allow orchid plants sit in water. Do not get water on the leaves or flowers. Never use water that has passed through a softener. Soil type, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence how much water orchid plants need. The soil dries out faster in winter because of the heat and low humidity in homes and offices. Too much or too little water is the main cause of Bud Blast, orchid buds dying before they open.
Fertilize weakly, weekly when an orchid plant is actively growing. Dilute your plant food to 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength. Do not feed an orchid plant when it is dormant or when the plant is in bloom. There are excellent orchid plant foods on the market. You can also use a well- balanced houseplant food at 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength.
Temperature is another important factor if you want indoor Cymbidium orchids to bloom. Ideal temperatures for the flower buds to set is 65°F-70°F (18.3°C-21.1°C) during the day and 10°-15° cooler at night. Temperature is especially important during the fall when orchid flowers are just starting to develop. Cymbidium plants can handle temperatures as low as 45°F (7° C), but do not do well in temperatures above 80° F (26.7°C). The higher the temperature, the more important it is to have good air movement around the plant.
High humidity is a necessity. If your home or office does not have at least 50% humidity, place your orchid plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure it is sitting on the pebbles and never in the water. Do not mist an orchid plant; it can cause fungal and bacterial plant diseases.
One of the nicest things about Cymbidium orchids is that they bloom in the winter when other indoor plant do not. The flower spikes on Cymbidium orchids set during the fall and winter when temperature are about 50°F (10°C) at night. Once the flower spikes appear, don’t move your Cymbidium orchid or keep the room too warm until the buds open. Blooms last longer when temperatures stay between 60°-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C). Be sure to stake the flower spikes so the blooms are above the leaves of the plant. Do not fertilize orchid plants while they are in bloom.
Mealy bugs can be removed using a Qtip dipped in alcohol. Wipe orchid plants with a soft cloth dipped in soapy water to remove spider mites, aphids, or scale. You can also use neem oil or insecticidal soap.
Cymbidium orchid diseases are caused by a fungus or virus. These plant diseases can quickly spread to others plants if you’re not careful. Viruses appear as pale streaks in the leaves. As the problem worsens, the leaves become pitted and bleached-out looking. Fungal infections cause yellow, brown, and then black leaves. Roots develop black spotted areas and the orchid cannot absorb water. Fungal infections on indoor orchid plant are the result of over- watering, poor air circulation, and wet foliage. Keep infected plants away from other plants or throw them out. Sterilize your scissors, knives, or other tools with alcohol before going from plant to plant. Treat fungal diseases with fungicides sold at local garden stores. Another way to treat Cymbidium orchid diseases is by using the Bordeaux Solution, a mixture of water, hydrated lime, and copper sulfate.
Cymbidium orchid plants need a special orchid soil or potting medium. Never use regular houseplant soil. Proper orchid planting medium contains peat moss, bark compost, and osmunda fiber. The right plant soil be found at any garden center.
Many of the new hybrid Cymbidium orchid plants are small enough to grow in 5”- 6” pots that can fit on a windowsill. Orchid plants like to be root-bound so don’t rush to move them to a larger container. Use clay or plastic pots for orchids. Be sure any pot you use has drainage holes. When re-potting a Cymbidium orchid shake off the excess soil and throw away any pseudobulbs that are shriveled and dried up.
Once the flowers die, find the nodes on the flower spike. Cut the spike off 1″ above the 3rd node from the bottom. Immediately remove dead or diseased parts on the plant or they will attract pests and diseases.
Propagate Cymbidium orchid plants in the spring when the plant has finished blooming. As orchid plants mature, they produce pseudobulbs. Pseudobulbs store water and nutrients and new plant leaves emerge from them. Cymbidium orchid plants should be divided every three or four years. To propagate these orchids, gently split the pseudo bulbs apart. Each section should have at least three healthy pseudobulbs. Center the orchid bulbs in the new container with the lower 1/3 of the bulb below the soil. The container should be only an inch or two larger than the pseudo bulb cluster.
Cymbidium orchid plants need a resting period if you want them to flower. Once a year move indoor orchid plants to a cool, dark area for a month and reduce how much water you give the plant. After the plant has rested, return it to its usual bright location.
Orchid plants are beautiful gifts for any occasion.
Cymbidium orchid plants are non-poisonous.
The best way to get an orchid plant to bloom is to make sure the plant is getting the right amount of water and light. Are the leaves a bright medium green, not dark green and not yellow green? This shows the orchid plant is getting enough bright light. Are the roots firm and whitish green, indicating that the plant is being watered properly? Is there good air circulation? Is the temperature between 65°-75F°(18.3-21.1°C) during the day and 15° cooler at night? If you think you’re caring for your orchid plant correctly, you may just have to be patient. It might be the wrong time of the year for it to bloom or your type of orchid plant may have to mature before it can produce more blooms.
The spots on the leaves of your indoor orchid plant could be a number of things. If you can scrape the bumps off, then it is probably a plant disease called scale. If the spots are surrounded by a yellow halo, it is a sign of a plant fungal infection. Another sign of a plant fungal infection is yellow spots with black edges. Because orchid plants require high humidity, they are prone to fungal and viral diseases. If infected with a plant disease, treat your plant with a commercial Fungicide or the Bordeaux Mixture (a combination of water, hydrated lime, and copper sulfate). Provide good air circulation around all orchid plants to prevent infections.
There are several reasons why leaves turn yellow on an orchid plant, the most common is that the leaves are old and are naturally dying. Some other causes of yellow leaves on orchid plants are: the plant needs more nitrogen; the temperature is too cold; the orchid is getting too much bright light; the roots have died from over- watering.
Brown and black streaks on the leaves of an orchid plant usually indicate a virus infection. I’d recommend immediately isolating the sick plant from your other plants before the virus spreads. Identifying which disease is affecting your plant is important so you can determine the proper treatment. If it is a fungal disease, it can be treated with any plant Fungicide sold at a local garden store; but viral diseases are very difficult to treat. Cut off all of the diseased areas and hope for the best."
46,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Prayer Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/prayer-plant/,,,"The prayer plant (Maranta leuconeura) is a very special plant. Every evening, when it gets dark, the leaves of a prayer plant fold up as though praying. There is a small joint between the stems and the leaves that allows this to occur. In the morning, as the plant reache for the light, the leaves unfurl and open again. Because of the name, a prayer plant is often sent as a gift to funerals. Prayer plants are part of the Maranta plant group which includes four closely related plants, the calathea, ctenanthe, stromanthe and the prayer plant. All varieties of Marantas are part of the larger Marantaceae family and are native to tropical Central and South America and the West Indies. Today, the prayer plant is primarily grown as an indoor plant.
The large leaves of a prayer plant have colorful veins and bright patterns in red, green, brown, and cream. The flowers, however, are small and insignificant. The patches of color in the leaves get darker and more vibrant as the plant matures. A prayer plant is a short, spreading plant that is usually about 8″ to 12″  (20-25cm) tall and 12″ to 20″ (30-50cm) wide. The broad, oval, paddle shaped leaves are 5″ to 7″  (13-18cm) long.
Herringbone or Red Prayer Plant (Maranta erthrophylla leuconeura)  has bold red veins.
Black Prayer Plant ( Maranta leuconeura var. “Massangeana”) has blackish, green leaves with silvery veins.
Green Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura “Kerchoveana”) is also called a Rabbit’s Tracks prayer plant because its green leaves have two rows of small, brown patches.
Dry air and low humidity cause stunted growth and brown leaf tips
Leaves curl and bottom leaves turn yellow when plant does not get enough water
Leaves burn and get ugly brown marks when the plant is in the direct sun
Leaf drop is caused by low humidity
Stems become limp and start to die when it is too cold or the soil is too wet
Provide high humidity
Keep winter temperature above 55°F
Keep soil barely moist at all times and water less in winter
Propagate by plant division when you repot in the spring every few years
This lovely plant with beautiful leaves is not difficult to grow if you provide the specific care it requires. Lack of humidity due to the dry air in our homes is the main cause of most  prayer plant problems. A prayer plant is a non-poisonous plant safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
How much light does a prayer plant need: Provide medium to high light, but avoid putting a prayer plant in the direct sun. When there is not enough light, the leaves close at night and do not fully open during the day. When there is too much light or direct sun, the color in the leaves fade.
How much water for a prayer plant: Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy at all times. Unlike most houseplants, a prayer plant does not like to have the soil dry out before you water. Water less in the winter when the plant is resting.
How to feed a prayer plant: This is is acid loving houseplant, fertilize with a food like Miracid diluted to ½ the recommended strength every two weeks in the spring and summer. It’s not necessary to feed a prayer plant in the winter and fall; it will also benefit from your extra tea. A prayer plant develops yellow leaves when it’s getting enough iron. You can fix the problem by using a cheated iron product available where fertilizers are sold.
Best temperature for a prayer plant: Provide warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C). Low temperatures and cold drafts damage the leaves.
Does a prayer plant need high humidity: High humidity is essential! When the air is too dry, a prayer plant may lose leaves, get brown leaf tips, or have stunted growth. The humidity in ours homes is often too low. Increase the humidity by grouping plants together, putting a small humidifier or bowl of water near the plant, or setting a prayer plant on a tray filled with water and small pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Does a prayer plant flower: The flowers are small and insignificant. It is the leaves that are the beautiful part of a prayer plant.
Prayer plant pests: Spider mites and aphids ca be a problem. learn how to recognize and treat these plant pests in the Glossary the website.
Prayer plant diseases: The high humidity a prayer plant needs encourages Leaf Spot disease and other fungal diseases. Providing good air circulation and keeping the leaves dry helps prevent diseases. Read more about Leaf Spot disease and how to identify and treat it in the Glossary of the website.
Best soil for a prayer plant: Use a well-aerated, peat based, indoor potting soil that retains water yet still drains quickly.
Proper pot for a prayer plant: Since this plant has very short roots, use a shallow pot that has drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a prayer plant: Trim the stems twice a year to keep the plant compact and bushy.
How to propagate a prayer plant: Plant division and stem cuttings are the best propagation methods. Read more about how to propagate plants in the Glossary of the website.
A prayer plant is a popular gift for funerals. The leaves close at night and unfold the next morning, as though the plant were praying.
A prayer plant is a non-poisonous houseplant and is safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
The main reasons a prayer plant gets brown leaf edges are dry air and low humidity.
A prayer plant doesn’t develop leaves as quickly when it’s producing flowers. Personally, I like the leaves more than the flowers, so I always cut the flowers off.
The leaves of a prayer plant usually fade because it is getting too much light. Move your plant to a shadier location and see if that solves the problem. Check the leaves carefully to be sure there is no spider mite infestation.
A prayer plant is an acid-loving houseplant, tea is acidic, so it’s definitely a good idea. Just don’t drown your plant in too much tea!!
There are several reasons why the leaves of a prayer plant shrivel up: too much direct sun, heavily chlorinated water, low humidity, and cold air."
47,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Podocarpus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/podocarpus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Podocarpus plant, also called a Buddhist Pine or Japanese Yew, is a very dense, upright, slow growing evergreen that originally came from China and Japan. It has long slender dark green leathery leaves. A Podocarpus plant grows straight up with very little side branching unless it is actively pruned. This plant is relatively simple to care for and adapts well to various conditions. It is easily trained to be a bonsai or a topiary. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. When planted outside in the ground a Podocarpus plant grows quite large, but when used indoors or on the porch as a potted plant, it remains a small tree or shrub.
A Podocarpus requires very bright indirect light. If it is not getting enough light the lower needles on the branches become large and elongated.
Keep the soil moist but not soggy; allow the top two inches to dry out before watering. Brown leaf tips or gray needles indicate over- watering.
Feed a Podocarpus every two weeks in the spring and summer when it is actively growing. Use a plant food that is designed for acid loving plants such as Miracid at 1/2 the recommended strength.
Podocarpus prefer cool temperatures between 50°-75°F (10°-23.9°C).
These plants do best in medium humidity. If your home is very dry, especially in the winter, set a small humidifier near your Podocarpus or place it on a bed of wet gravel. Be sure the plant is sitting on the gravel and not in the water.
The flowers of this plant are very small and inconspicuous.
Podocarpus are susceptible to Mealy Bugs and Scale.
Although the soil should be kept somewhat moist, over watering leads to root rot. Sooty Mold is another disease that can infect a Podocarpus.
Use a well-aerated acidic soil. Add perlite or sand if your soil seems too heavy or clay-like.
A Podocarpus must be actively and aggressively pruned to maintain any kind of shape. Pruning back the new growth on the vertical stem encourages side branches and a fuller bushier plant.
Propagate a Podocarpus using soft wood stem cuttings in the early spring.
A Podocarpus has a level #1 toxicity if eaten. However, various parts of the plant, especially the seeds within the berries are very harmful to dogs, cats, and horses. This plant should be kept away from small children and animals.
First stake the main vertical stem of your Podocarpus; next prune back the new growth on the vertical stem. Cutting off the new growth encourages side branches. Your Podocarpus will become sturdier and bushier in no time.
The main reason a Podocarpus gets brown tips is from over-watering. Cold drafts and very dry air can also cause brown tips.
The Black Dust is called sooty mold. sooty molds are a form of fungi that grow on the sugary honeydew secreted by Aphids, scales, the whitefly, and other insects that suck the sap from plants. sooty mold is an unsightly black powder that can quickly coat the leaves of a plant in just a few weeks. The fungus itself doesn’t really harm the plant; it just ruins the plant’s appearance. What you need to do is get rid of the insects that are secreting the honeydew that is attracting the sooty mold."
48,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Calla Lily Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/calla-lily-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Calla Lily plant, Zantedeschia aethiopica, produces beautiful flowers when grown outdoors, planted in the ground in a warm area, or indoors grown in a decorative pot next to a sunny window. This elegant plant, native to the marshes of South Africa, is not a true lily or even in the Lilium family. A Calla Lily is a member of the Araceae family and a relative of the caladium plant. The long-lasting flowers are popular in wedding bouquets where they are a symbol of purity and beauty.
A Calla Lily plant is grown from small rhizomes. A rhizome is a long, thick, modified stem that grows horizontally underground. It produces shoots that grow upwards and out of the soil and roots that grow downwards. Rhizomes, like plant bulbs, not only support the plant but store food and other nutrients. The large, tubular or funnel shaped Calla Lily flowers (spathes), grow atop tall, thick stems and have a finger-like yellow spadix in the center. The flower can be as large as 10″ (25.4cm) long. The long tapered green leaves of the plant may be streaked with faint white or yellow spots.  Today, thanks to the many new hybrids developed by breeders throughout the world, Calla Lilies can be found not only in white, but also pink, orange, fuchsia, red, yellow, dark maroon, and cream.
Needs bright, indirect light but no direct sun
Keep soil moist but never soggy at all times
Feed every 2 weeks when flowering and monthly when there are only leaves.
Cool temperatures 50°-75°F (10°-24°C)Keep in small pot to encourage more flowers
Plant must have a 2-3 month dormant (rest) period if you want it to flower
Propagate by dividing the rhizomes
Zantedeschia aethiopica – “White Calla Lily” – white flowers
Zantedeschia elliottiana – “Golden Calla Lily”  bright yellow flowers
Zantedeschia  “Picasso” – dark purple flowers with a creamy white border
Zantedeschia “Mango” –  peach colored flowers with a dark brown center and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia  “Captain Amigo” –  golden yellow flowers that blend into deep orange and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia  “Mozart “ –  peachy pink flowers and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia “Black Star” –  dark purple almost black flowers and green leaves with white spots.
Zantedeschia “Captain  Romance”  deep pink and cream colored flowers and green leaves with white spots
A Calla Lily is a beautiful plant that produces elegant looking flowers. It is well worth the extra time and effort it takes to follow the care tips below, especially when its time for the plant to have a rest and go dormant for a few months. A Calla Lily is a poisonous plant and should be kept way from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Calla Lilies require at least six hours a day of very bright indirect light. Avoid direct sun, especially during the middle of the day, since it will burn the leaves and flowers.
These plants like moist soil at all times. Calla Lilies are not drought resistant and should never be allowed to totally dry out. Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Never allow a Calla Lily to sit in water for more than 15 minutes.
Fertilize an indoor Calla Lily every two weeks when the plant is flowering with a liquid plant food low in nitrogen. When the plant is producing only leaves and no flowers, fertilize monthly. Always dilute the plant food to ½ the recommended strength. If your Calla Lily is planted outside, use a granular plant food instead of a liquid fertilizer.
Room temperatures should be between 50°-75°F (10°-24°C) for optimal growth. Keep Calla Lilies away from heating and air conditioning vents. If planted outdoors, be sure to dig up the Calla Lily bulbs and bring them inside before temperatures dip below freezing.
Calla Lilies do well in average humidity.
The flowers of a Calla Lily are really spaths similar to those of a Peace Lily but much more impressive. The plant usually blooms for about six weeks during the late spring and early summer. Keeping the plant root- bound encourages more flowers. Calla Lilies may be forced to bloom at any time indoors. The long lasting cut flowers are perfect in bouquets and flower arrangements.
Examine a Calla Lily frequently for signs of scale or aphids.
Calla Lilies are susceptible to various viruses and bacterial infections, especially rhizome rot and gray mold. These problems become evident when leaves and stems start to turn yellow before the plant is normally entering its dormant phase.
Use a good peat moss based potting soil that is well aerated and drains quickly. You can add builder’s sand or perlite if the soil seems too heavy and clay-like.
Bulbs can be removed from their pots and stored in a cool dark location during their yearly dormant period. After 2-3 months of rest, plant the Calla Lily rhizomes (bulbs) in a clean pot with fresh rich soil. Use deep pots for Calla Lily bulbs, planting one bulb in a five-or six-inch pot, or two or three bulbs in an eight-inch pot. Plant the Calla Lily rhizomes (bulbs) deep enough so that they are covered by at least twice the height of the bulb. Calla Lilies usually bloom about 60 days after the bulbs are planted.
Calla Lilies only need to be pruned when they are entering their dormant or resting phase.
Callas Lilies can be propagated by division and seeds. The easiest method is to simply divide the rhizomes in the early spring and plant a single rhizome (bulb) in a deep six inch pot. Wait until the plant has started to produce new green leaves before going back to a regular fertilization program.
Calla Lily, a bulb plant, becomes dormant once a year. After the plant has finished blooming, the leaves turn yellow and then brown. Once this occurs prune the plant down to the soil level and put it in a cool dark area where the temperature is above freezing but no higher than 50°F (10°C) for 2-3 months. Keep the soil very dry, watering sparingly every few weeks to prevent the bulbs from drying out. The area where the plant is stored should be low in humidity otherwise the bulbs get moldy and rot. After two or three months, return your Calla Lily to a bright warm spot and start watering. Once green leaves develop, feed with a fertilizer specifically for bulbs at ½ the recommended strength to encourage the new growth. The plant should start to bloom again in 6-8 weeks.
Calla Lilies are lovely gifts for any occasion.
A Calla Lily is a very poisonous houseplant with a #3 toxicity level. Please keep it away from small children and pets. This plant contains high levels of calcium oxalate and ingestion may cause severe burning and swelling of the mouth, throat, lips, and tongue. Stomach distress and diarrhea can also occur.
After your Calla Lilies finish blooming you’ll see a seed pod hanging just behind where the flower was. Let the seed pod remain on the plant until it turns yellow and becomes soft. Once you remove the pod, gently break it open and remove the seeds from the inner pulp. If you want to grow Calla Lilies from seed you have to be very patient. Calla Lilies usually take 3 or more years to produce flowers after the seeds are planted.
Calla Lilies take about 12-14 weeks for the flowers to look their best. So I’d recommend planting the bulbs about 3 1/2 months before you plan to use the flowers. Be sure to have a back up flower plan in case the Calla Lilies have a problem and don’t produce the number of blooms you’re hoping for in time for your wedding.
There are several reasons why a Calla Lily produces only leaves and no flowers.
Just the opposite, you should never feed a Calla Lily when it is in bloom. Good quality Calla Lily bulbs do not need much fertilizer so always err on the side of less food rather than more."
49,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/5,Pothos Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pothos-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An “Epipremnum aureum“, or a Pothos plant as we know it, was originally found in the jungles of Malaysia, China, Australia, and islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Since the light at the floor of a dense, tropical jungle is often not very bright, pothos plants used the aerial roots on their long vines to cling to the trunks of trees and grow upwards towards the sunlight. Pothos plants are sometimes referred to as “Devil’s Ivy” because it is a very forgiving plant that quickly recovers and starts growing again even after suffering from poor care and poor growing conditions.
A pothos plant is a highly adaptable, glossy-leafed plant with leathery, pointed, heart-shaped leaves. When growing outdoors, the leaves of a pothos plant can be as large as 10”-12” (25cm-30cm). Indoors, the leaves are much smaller, usually ranging in size from 4”-6” (10cm-15cm). The solid green pothos is often confused with a heart-leaf philodendron. A pothos plant produces long, vines and looks wonderful in a hanging basket. You can also attach the stems to a moss or styrofoam pole and have a tall, upright plant.
The leaves of this hardy plant come in several colors and leaf patterns.
Golden Pothos plant has yellow and green leaves.
Marble Queen Pothos has white and green leaves.
Jade Pothos has solid green leaves.
Neon Pothos has bright green neon-colored leaves
n’joy Pothos has green leaves with a cream and yellow variegation.
Satin Pothos has dark green leaves with silver markings
    
Satin Pothos              Neon Pothos                       n’Joy Pothos              Marble Queen Pothos
Minimum temperature 55°F (12.8°C)
Select the right variety for the lighting in your home
Easily propagated from stem cutting in the spring
Allow the tip 50% of the soil to dry out before watering
Pothos are easy to care for and a perfect plant for people just starting to grow indoor houseplants (as long they are careful not to over water). Best of all, there is a pothos plant variety for almost any location in your home or business. These plants are  poisonous and are toxic to dogs, cats, and children. Please keep the long vines out of reach. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplant.
How much light for a pothos plant: A Green Jade pothos with solid green leaves does well in low light. A Golden Pothos with yellow and green patterned leaves likes medium light. The Marble Queen pothos with green and white variegated leaves grows best in medium to bright indirect light. The lighter the colors in the leaves of a pothos plant, the more light the plant requires.
How to water a Pothos plant: Water well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Over-watering is the main reason a pothos plant dies. Bright yellow leaves indicate that the soil has dried out a bit too much before you watered it. Leaves turn pale yellow and get black marks when a pothos plant is over- watered. Over watering a pothos plant also causes new growth to turn black.
How to fertilize a Pothos plant: Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing and monthly in the fall and winter. Use a well-balanced plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a Pothos plant: grows well in temperatures between 55°F – 80°F (12.8°C – 26.7°C). If temperatures drop below 45°F (7.2°C), a pothos plant stops growing and the leaves turn black.
Basic household humidity is all a Pothos plant requires
Pothos plant pests: One of the great things about a Pothos plant is that it is rarely bothered by plant pests. However, if the soil stays too wet and is not allowed to partially dry out, fungus gnats may appear. Mealy bugs are another pest that can sometimes be a problem.
Pothos plant diseases: Over-watering can causes plant diseases such as crown, leaf, and root rot. Once the roots are damaged, it is difficult to save a pothos plant.
Best soil for a Pothos plant: Use a well-aerated, quick-draining potting soil that dries out quickly. This type of soil prevents the roots from staying wet too long and eventually dying.
A Pothos likes to be root-bound in a small pot. Do not rush to move the plant to a larger pot, wait until the roots have filled the existing container. The new pot should be only one size larger than the current pot and have drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a Pothos plant: Aggressively prune the long vines to keep the plant looking bushy and full. 5”- 6” pothos stem cuttings can be rooted in water or vermiculite and used to propagate new plants.
How to propagate a pothos plant: Take stem tip cuttings in the spring and summer. Read complete care instructions on how to propagate a Pothos plant using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
NASA lists a Pothos plant as a “Clean Air Plant” that helps remove harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde from the air.
Pothos plants are poisonous plants with a level #2 toxicity, and is toxic to dogs, cats, and small children.
A pothos plant gets yellow leaves a few days after you water it when you allow the soil to get too dry before watering. Water well, until the water comes out the bottom drip holes. Don’t water again until the top 50% of the soil dries out or the leaves start to droop a little. You can save an under-watered pothos plant, but an over-watered pothos can quickly die.
A pothos plant develops brown, mushy stems and new growth turns black when your pothos plant is over-watered. Cut off the dead stems and don’t water your pothos plant again until the soil has totally dried out; this gives new roots a chance to develop. You can also carefully take the pothos plant out its pot and get rid of the wet soil. Allow the plant to sit out bare root overnight and replant in new, fresh, dry soil.
You need to aggressively prune a pothos plant to help it get it full again. By cutting several inches off of each of the long runners, you’ll encourage new growth to develop all along the stem. You can use the Stem Cuttings to propagate a new pothos plant.
Pothos plant leaves turn black when the air in the room is too cold (below 55° for a long period of time). Cut the damaged leaves off your pothos plant; trim back the stems, and move your plant to a warmer location. The roots are fine and your pothos plant should grow back in no time."
50,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Cat Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/cat-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Cat Palm (Chamaedorea cataractarum) is also called a Cascade Palm or Cataract Palm. Cat Palms are native to southeastern Mexico and resemble the inexpensive Areca Palm and the very pricey Kentia Palm. During Victorian times, having a Cat Palm in your home indicated that you were high up on the social ladder. These plants were often displayed in the windows of homes so everyone passing by would know that a rich and respected person lived there.
Although in its native environment a Cat Palm can grow as tall as 6ft (1.8m) and have a width up to 8ft (2.4m), indoors a Cat Palm is a slow growing, smaller plant eventually reaching a height of about 4-6ft (1.22m-1.8m). This compact, bushy, airy plant doesn’t have a trunk like some other indoor palms. The bright green, pinnate (feather like) fronds grow in a clump-like fashion off thin shoots. The fronds are made up of leaflets that can be 1ft (30cm) long and 1” (2.5cm) wide.
Place in bright light, but no direct sun.
Keep the soil barely moist, never allow the soil to totally dry out.
Too much plant food is worse than too little.
Provide high humidity, dry air can severely damage a cat palm.
Avoid placing a Cat Palm near air conditioners, cold drafts, or heaters.
Yellow fronds:  Underwatering
Brown fronds:  Overwatering
Brown leaf tips: Dry air due to low humidity, using water from a water softener, or using water with a lot of fluorine or chlorine in it
A Cat Palm is an easy care, attractive plant that is safe to have around pets and children. An added plus, most palm plants have been shown to clean the air of harmful pollutants.
How much light for a Cat Palm: Provide bright, indirect light but no direct sun. Direct sun, especially in the afternoon, burns the fronds.
How to water a Cat Palm: Water often enough to keep the barely soil moist, but not soggy, at all times. Never allow the soil to totally dry out. The fronds of a Cat Palm turn yellow when the soil is too dry. Salty water or water containing chemicals such as fluoride, chlorine cause leaf tip burn. Entire fronds turn brown when a Cat Palm is over watered.
How to fertilize a Cat Palm: Less rather than more plant food is always better with palms. Feed a Cat Palm monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize only once or twice during winter and fall when the plant is not actively growing.
Best temperature for a Cat Palm: These plants do well in 70°- 80°F (21.1°-26.7°C) during the day and no lower than 45°F(7.2°C) at night. Palms like to be in a warm environment, but too much dry heat causes leaf damage. Keep Cat Palms away from air conditioners, heating vents, fire places, and cold winter drafts,
Does a Cat Palm need high humidity: A Cat Palm gets brown leaf tips and does not grow well when the humidity is low and the air is dry. Ideally the humidity in the room should be 55% or higher; but this is rarely the case in our homes or office. There are several ways to increase the humidity around your plants: place a small humidifier in the room; group plants together to create a mini greenhouse effect; place your plant on a “wet pebble tray. A wet pebble tray consists of a shallow pan of water and a layer of small pebbles that reaches above the water line. Be sure your plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water,
Cat Palm plant pests: Spider mites, scale, mealy bugs, and ants can be a problem. Read more about these pests and how to treat them in the Glossary of the website. Never use a commercial insecticide spray on a palm, it will damage the fronds. Use Insecticidal soap, Neem Oil, or warm soapy water to treat plant pests.
Cat Palm plant diseases: Leaf Spot disease is a fungal disease that affects the fronds of a Cat Palm. It appears as a reddish-brown lesion between 1/8-1/4″ in length. Learn how to recognize and treat Leaf Spot disease in the Glossary of the website.
Best soil for a Cat Palm: Use a loose potting soil that drains quickly. If your soil is heavy and clay-like, add some peat moss or sand. If the soil constantly stays too wet, a Cat Palm develops root rot and may die.
Pot size for a Cat Palm: Palms grow better when they are slightly root- bound. Do not re-pot until the roots have filled the existing container. The new pot should be only one size larger than the existing pot and must have drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape. Do not allow a Cat Palm to sit in the excess water.
How to prune a Cat Palm: Immediately prune any yellow or brown fronds. You can trim brown leaf tips, caused by low humidity or too much fertilizer, with a wet scissors. Using a wet scissors usually prevents the browning or yellowing from spreading up the entire leaf.
How to propagate a Cat Palm: Commercially palm plants are propagated by seeds. Seed propagation is not an easy to do and best left to the professionals; using the offsets (a shoot growing sideways off the base of the plant) is much more successful. You’ll have to take the plant out of the pot and find an offset growing out of the root ball. Remove the offset, and any roots attached to it, and plant it in a small pot of soil. The pot should only be 1″-2″ larger than the root ball of the offset.
Is a Cat Palm a clean air plant: Most indoor palms have been shown to clean the air of harmful chemicals.
Cat Palms are non-poisonous and safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
You should never repot a palm until its roots have filled the existing pot. These plants really like to be root bound. I’d put it back into its original small pot, keep it moist but not soggy, and place it in good indirect bright light. It should start to recover. Also, wait at least 6 weeks before re-potting a new plant tallow it to get used to its new surroundings.
Plants like to be fed when they are actively growing in the spring and summer. When you do feed a palm be sure to dilute the food to 1/2 the recommended strength and only feed once a month. If the fronds start to turn yellow, this may indicate that the plant needs more nitrogen, magnesium, or potassium.
There are several possible causes: too much salt or fluoride in the water you are using or too much fertilizer buildup in the soil. Low humidity coupled with minerals in the water can also cause tip burn."

Although a close relative of the Boston fern, both are members of the Nephrolepis family (Sword family), the Kimberly Queen fern has erect, narrow, and sword shaped fronds while the Boston fern has long, arching fronds. The Boston fern is a bit messy, often shedding small leaflets, while the Kimberly Queen fern rarely sheds leaves. Like all ferns, a Kimberley Queen fern does prefer and grows more quickly in high humidity but still does well in basic household humidity.
In warm, temperate climates, where the temperature stays above 60°F (15.5°C), the extremely adaptable Kimberley Queen fern can be grown outdoors in the shade or partial shade. When given enough space, these ferns can sometimes grow as large as 3ft high and 3ft wide. In cooler climates these plants need to be brought indoors for the winter.
As a houseplant, the Kimberley Queen fern grows much faster and needs less care than a Boston fern. The  green, sword shaped fronds can be an attractive mixture of those growing straight upward and those gracefully arching over.
Bright indirect light from a north or east-facing window
Brown dots on back of fronds are not pests or signs of disease. They are spores and can be used for propagation
Repot on spring when roots have filled the existing pot
High humidity is a plus
Keep soil barely moist and never allow it to totally dry out
Best temperature is 60°F-70F° (15.5°C-21.1°C)
A Kimberly Queen Fern likes medium to bright indirect light but too much bright light fades the leaves. If you’re careful not to over water or over fertilize, a Kimberly Queen fern almost takes care of itself.  This durable plant grows well and looks beautiful hanging in a basket in front of a north facing window. Other added benefits of a Kimberly Queen fern are that it is an excellent “clean air plant” eliminating harmful chemicals from the air. It is a not a poisonous plant and is safe to have around children, dogs, cats, and other pets.
Amount of light a Kimberly Queen fern needs: This fern prefers bright, indirect light and grows well hanging in front of a window with a north or east exposure. If the light is too bright, the leaves of a Kimberly Queen fern may lose their vibrant green color.
How to water a Kimberly Queen fern: Allow the top 25%-35% of the soil to dry-out before watering your fern. The fronds may turn a pale green when the fern needs water. Crispy brown fronds, especially in the center of a Kimberly Queen fern, is a sign that the plant is being over-watered. Avoid using “hard” water, water that has a lot of salt in it or has passed through a water softener, or water high in fluorine or chlorine.
Feed a Kimberly Queen fern monthly with a balanced, liquid plant food when the plant is actively growing. Dilute the plant food to 1/4 to 1/2 the recommended strength; diluting the fertilizer helps prevent leaf tip burn.
The best temperature for a Kimberly Queen fern is 60°F-70F° (15.5°C-21.1°C). Keep all indoor plants away from fireplaces, heaters, and air conditioners.
All ferns, including a Kimberly Queen fern, prefer high humidity. If the leaf tips on your Kimberly Queen fern start to turn brown because of low humidity, try setting the plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the fern is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. You can also place a small humidifier in the room near your Kimberly Queen fern.
Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites are the main plant pests that may injure a Kimberly Queen fern. Commercial pesticides will damage the fronds so always use a mild, soapy water spray to prevent and treat pests.
A Kimberly Queen fern is fairly disease resistant.
A good soil for a Kimberly Queen fern is an indoor potting soil mixed with some peat moss to help it drain quickly.
When to repot a Kimberly Queen fern: Repot the fern to the next size pot, and nothing larger, when the roots of the plant have filled the container that it is in. Ferns grow best when a little root-bound; don’t be in a rush to move a fern to a larger pot. Do not fertilize a Kimberly Queen fern for several weeks after re-potting.
Prune a Kimberly Queen fern by removing dead leaves or entire brown fronds as soon as they appear.
The best way to propagate a Kimberly Queen fern is by plant division. Carefully pull the root ball of the plant in half or in quarters. Do not use a a knife or scissors to separate to root ball. Plant the new, smaller sections of the Kimberly Queen fern in small pots only an inch or two larger than the new root ball.
A Kimberly Queen Fern is a clean air plant that removes formaldehyde from the air.
Kimberly Queen ferns are non poisonous plants and are not toxic to cats, dogs, or small children.
The fronds of a Kimberly Queen Fern need plenty of space to spread out. If they touch a window or table they will turn brown and stop growing. Excessive fertilizer and low humidity can also burn the tips.
A Kimberly Queen is one of the few ferns that can live in the direct sun. However, it will be happier and easier to care for if placed in medium indirect light.
Although a Kimberly queen fern does not have the long draping fronds of a Boston fern, it is quite superior in every other way. It is easy to grow and hard to kill unless you over- water. The large to almost upright fronds rarely drop leaves.
A Kimberly Queen does very well outside whether in a pot or planted in your garden if the temperature is fairly moderate. It will stop growing if the temperature drops below 55°F (12.8°C) and totally die if the temperature drops below freezing."

The plant is native to the tropics of India, South Asia, and Malaysia. When grown outside, a rubber plant, part of the banyan tree family, can reach a height well over 100ft (30 m) and has a thick, sturdy trunk that can be 6ft (2 m) wide. Other common names for the Ficus elastica are Rubber Fig, Indian Rubber Bush, Indian Rubber Tree, Rubber Bush. Today, rubber tree plants grow outdoors in warm, temperate climates throughout the world, though they are much shorter than the ones originally found growing in nature.
Rubber tree plants have thick, leathery, glossy, oval leaves that are about  4”-14” (10cm-35cm) long and 2″-6″ (5cm-15cm) wide. Once damaged, the leaves cannot be trimmed and should be cut off. Interestingly, the leaves of younger plants are larger than those of more mature plants. When small, this versatile plant can be used as table plant and eventually as a bushy floor plant or tall tree. The easy to care for rubber tree can grow up to 10ft tall in a bright room with tall ceilings.
A rubber tree is an extremely popular indoor plant and there are many different varieties with different colored leaves.
Ficus elastica “decora” has shiny, thick, dark green leaves.
Ficus elastica ‘robustica” is a new hardier variety of the Ficus “decora” with larger, wider leaves
Ficus elastica “tineke” has colorful, patterned leaves in green, pink, cream, and yellow.
Ficus elastica burgundy (Black Prince) has very dark almost blackish/ green leaves with a burgundy undertones and stems
Ficus elastica tricolor, also called a “Ruby Red” or “Belize” has leaves that are rose colored when they first emerge and gradually become dark green with leaf patterns in white and grayish green. Ficus elastica “doescheri” has green and gray blotches of color in the center of the leaves and creamy white margins on the outer edges of the leaves.
        
F. Tineke                  F. Burgundy                F. Tri-Color              F. decora
Like all ficus plants, a rubber tree doesn’t like to be moved around to different locations.
Prefers constant temperatures above 55°F (12.8°C)
Keep the plant away from cold drafts and heaters.
Bright indirect light
Be careful not to over water
The rubber tree is a poisonous plant and is toxic to small children, dogs, cats, and other pets. Read more about houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Light requirements for a rubber tree plant: Bright, indirect light especially for the varieties that have cream, pink, or light red variations in the leaves. A rubber tree plant with solid, dark green leaves can grow in medium light but may become leggy when there is not enough light. Direct sun will burn the leaves.
Water requirements for a rubber tree plant: Allow the top few inches of soil (25%-30% depending upon the pot size) to dry out before watering. It is confusing, but yellow leaves can develop when the plant is either over or under- watered. Like its cousin, the ficus benjamina, green leaves fall off and new growth turns black when the plant is over- watered.
How to fertilize a rubber tree plant: Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
The best temperature for a rubber tree plant: 60°F – 75°F (15°C-24° C) Temperatures below 55°F (12.8°C) can damage the leaves
How much humidity does a rubber tree plant need: Basic household humidity
Does a rubber tree plant flower: This plant rarely flowers indoors.
Rubber tree plant pests: Spider mites, aphids, scale, and thrips can all be a problem. See a picture and read how to identify and treat each of these plant pests in the Glossary of the website. The regularly spaced, tiny, white spots that form on rubber tree plant leaves and are sometimes mistaken for insects, are called cystoliths. These spots are calcium carbonate crystals and are not harmful to the plant.
Rubber tree plant diseases: Root rot, due to over watering, is the main problem. Root rot often occurs when a rubber tree is directly planted into a decorative container that has no drip holes in the bottom or it is planted in a container that is too large. In both cases, the soil stay wet too long and the roots are destroyed. Leaves turn yellow, green leaves may simply drop off, and new growth turns black when a rubber tree plant has root rot.
Type of soil for a rubber tree plant: Use a light, airy potting soil that drains quickly.
What size pot for a rubber tree plant: Do not rush to repot the plant, wait until the roots have filled the existing container. Always use the next size pot and nothing larger. The new container for your rubber tree plant must have drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a rubber tree plant: Prune the branches to maintain the size and shape you want your rubber tree plant to be. Read about propagation and how to use the stem tip cutting to propagate a new plant in the glossary of the website.
How to propagate a rubber tree plant: These plants are usually propagated using leaf-tip cuttings. However, if the stems are thick, you can also use the air layering technique. Providing warm temperatures and high humidity helps with the propagation process. You can read more about how to propagate a plant using leaf tip cuttings and air layering in the Glossary of the website.
Is a rubber tree plant poisonous: The sap of a rubber tree plant is toxic and can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. The plant should be kept away from small children, dogs and cats. Always wear gloves and a long sleeve shirt when pruning, or propagating a rubber tree plant.
If you have your rubber tree plant in the direct sun, those brown marks are sunburn. Move your plant away from the window and into bright, indirect light. If the plant is not in direct sun the marks could be Leaf Spot Disease. Keep water off the leaves and don’t mist the plant.
It sounds like your rubber Tree Plant is getting yellow leaves due to a watering problem. Rubber Trees develop yellow leaves when they are either over or under-watered. Check your soil to see which one it is and either water more or cut back on your watering.
You can make your bare, thin rubber tree plant look better by cutting off the growing tip of the main stem; once you do that, the plant will branch out along the stem. Use stem tip cuttings to start new plants. Another way to make a rubber tree bushier is to make small slits above the notches in the stem where the old leaves fell off; new leaves will grow from each slit.
After you cut off the stem tip from a rubber Ttee plant, place it a jar of water for about an hour. This stops the sticky white sap from sealing the cut end of the stem. Once you remove the stem tip from the water, dip the cut end in Rooting Hormone, and plant immediately. Hope this works for you."

Also called a Ficus Repens, it is an excellent table plant, hanging plant, or climbing plant. Since the fast- growing vines of a Creeping Fig easily cling to just about anything, it’s also a great plant  if you want to create a topiary. The small (1”-2”), thin, delicate, heart- shaped leaves grow on wiry stems. As a ficus pumila matures, it develops a dense. dark green, mat-like appearance.  These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. The beautiful, variegated type of  Creeping Fig needs more bright indirect light than the solid green Creeping Fig plant.

Variegated F. Pumila (Creeping Fig)
A ficus pumila needs indirect light from an east or west-facing window. Plants with variegated leaves require even more light. Creeping fig plants do surprisingly well in strong artificial light.
Keep the soil moist but never soggy. The leaves of a ficus pumila deteriorate if the soil is allowed to repeatedly dry out. Reduce water during the winter.
Fertilize monthly in the spring, summer, and fall with a basic houseplant food diluted to half the recommended strength. During fall and winter, fertilize every other month.
A ficus pumila, also called a ficus repens, does well in temperatures between 55°F-75°F ( 12.8°C-23.9°C)
This plant likes plenty of humidity. Place it on a pebble tray filled with water, be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water; put a humidifier close by; or group plants together to cause a mini- greenhouse effect.
Mealy bugs, scale, whiteflies, and spider mites.
No serious disease problems
Use a highly organic peat-based soil that drains quickly.
Use stem cuttings in the early spring.
A ficus pumila has a #1 toxicity level.
Leaves shrivel and fall off a creeping fig when the soil gets to dry. Keep the soil moist but never soggy and keep the soil a bit drier during the winter.
A ficus pumila (creeping fig) likes humidity, but keeping the leaves wet from misting attracts Mealy Bugs which are what those “white, sticky, cotton- like” things are. Spray your plant with the ” green solution” (instructions on how to make this water and alcohol pest killer are is in the Glossary) to get rid of the Mealy Bugs; be sure to spray all parts of the plant.
Do not rush to repot a creeping fig (ficus pumila). This plant grows best when root bound in a small pot. For the first year or two, when the plant is immature and small, repot it in the spring. Be sure to use a pot only an inch or two larger than the original pot. Once the plant is mature, it does not need repotting; replace the top few inches of soil with new rich organic soil once a year.
The leaves of a ficus repens (creeping fig) become pale and anemic looking when the plant os getting too much sun. Move your plant away from a southern or western exposure to a northern or eastern exposure. Also examine the plant closely to make sure it doesn’t have spider mites."
54,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Pilea Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pilea-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The pilea plant, a member of the nettle family, is an attractive hanging or table plant native to China and Viet Nam. There are many different types of pilea plants, and all are easy to grow, even for a new plant enthusiast. One of the easiest to care for is the Aluminum plant (Pilea Cadierei) also called the Watermelon Pilea. This variety is grown for its attractive leaves rather than its very small, white flowers. The dark green, oval, puffy foliage has distinct, shiny, silver markings on the upper side of the leaf that look like someone splashed aluminum colored paint on it. The leaves on an Aluminum plant are usually about 3” (7.6cm) long and the height of the plant 6″ to 12″ inches (15-31 cm.). All pilea plant varieties are small, soft- stemmed plants, the tallest usually no more than 12″-18″ (30-45 cm) tall. Pilea plants need to be pruned frequently if you want them to stay full and bushy and not become leggy and bare looking.
Although the “Aluminum” Pilea plant is the most popular type, there are several other Pilea plant varieties that make beautiful houseplants.
Artillery Plant (Pilea microphylla) resembles a fern with tiny, oval to rounded succulent, light green leaves (1/4” to 1/2” long).
Moon Valley Pilea (Pilea involucrata “Mollis”) is a bushy plant that got it name because the leaves, yellow green with dark copper veins and undersides, were thought to resemble the craters and valleys on the moon.
Norfolk Friendship Plant (Pilea involucrata ‘Norfolk’ Angel Wings) has ovate (oval), furrowed leaves that start out reddish pink and gradually turn a bronze/red with splashes of metallic silver.
Chinese Money Plant also called a Coin plant or Pancake plant because of its bright green coin shaped leaves.
Pilea ‘Dark Mystery’ has long, serrated, dark green/brown textured leaves with a silver line down the center of each leaf.
 
        
Artillery Plant        Moon Valley            Norfolk Friendship     Chinese Money              Dark Mystery
Prune frequently and aggressively
Roots grow quickly so repot annually
Keep in a warm in temperatures above 55°F (12.8C)
Provide bright light but avoid direct sun
Keep the soil barley moist except in winter when it needs to dry out a bit more
The beauty of a pilea plant lies in the texture and color in the tops of the leaves, so always place the plant where that can be easily seen.
How much light does a pilea plant need: A pilea plant needs bright indirect light. Direct sun burns the very attractive leaves and insufficient light causes the plant to become leggy as it stretches for more light.
How to water a pilea plant: Keep the soil of a pilea plant slightly moist, but not soggy at all times. During the cooler months or when your pilea plant is not producing new leaves, allow the top 2-3 inches of soil to dry out before watering.
How to fertile a pilea plant: Feed a pilea plant every two weeks when it is actively growing with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a pilea plant: This plant likes to be warm all of the time. The best temperature for a pilea plant is 60°-75°F ( 18.3°-23.9°C).
Humidity for a pilea plant: A pilea plant require very high humidity to keep the leaves looking beautiful. If your home is dry, place the plant on a tray of pebbles filled with water. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Does a pilea plant flower: A pilea plant produces very small flowers that are over- shadowed by its lovely, distinctive looking leaves.
Pilea plant pests: Spider mites, aphids, fungus gnats, scale, and thrip can all be a problem for a pilea plant. See a picture and read how to identify and treat these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
Pilea plant diseases: Because of the high humidity a pilea requires, both bacterial and fungal Leaf Spot disease are a problem. Prevent this disease by keeping the leaves dry ((do not mist a pilea plant) and providing good air circulation around the plant. Read more about how to identify and treat Leaf Spot disease in the Glossary of the website.
Right soil for a pilea plant: Use a loose, airy soil that drains quickly for a pilea plant. Add peat moss or other organic matter to a commercial houseplant soil to plant your pilea plant develop a good root structure.
Pot size for a pilea plant: A pilea plant is one of the few houseplants that do not like to be root-bound. The roots of a pilea plant grow very quickly so check annually to see if the plant needs a larger container.
How to prune a pilea plant: A pilea plant must be frequently and aggressively pruned to prevent it from becoming leggy and unattractive. You can use the cutting to propagate new plants.
How to propagate a pilea plant: A pilea plant is easily propagated using stem cuttings. Read detailed instructions on how to use stem cuttings to propagate your plants in the Glossary of the website.
Does a pilea plant have a resting period: A pilea plant becomes dormant in the winter. During this time, the plat needs less water.
Is a pilea plant poisonous: A pilea plant is a non-poisonous plant and safe to have around children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
If a pilea is damaged by the cold, it will drop all of its leaves. However, if you cut back the damaged stems, new growth quickly develops once you move it indoors to a warm bright spot.
The brown spots on the leaves of your pilea are caused by Leaf Spot Disease. Leaf Spot often affects indoor plants that require high humidity. Remove the diseased leaves, keep water off of the healthy leaves, do not mist the plant, and provide good air circulation around the plant. If the Leaf Spot Disease persists, get rid of the plant before the disease spreads to other plants.
The leaves on your pilea are wilted and turning a funny color because you are watering it during the winter the same way you watered it in the summer. As the weather gets cooler, you need to water a pilea and most houseplants less since they are not growing very much. Allow the soil to dry out and see if any new shoots appear, hopefully a few roots are still alive."
55,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Pencil Cactus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pencil-cactus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Pencil Cactus, Euphorbia tirucalli, is not a cactus plant at all but rather a member of the euphorbia family like a Poinsettia. This unique looking plant, native to Africa and India, is also referred to as Indian Tree Spurge, Naked Lady Plant, Aveloz, Milk Bush Plant, and Petroleum Plant. The green succulent stems of a Pencil Cactus, which are about the width of a pencil, branch upwards in an almost geometrical pattern.  A Pencil Cactus grows quickly and can reach a height of 10′-15′ outdoors and up to 6′ in an indoor container.  Although this is an easy care plant that just needs bright light and a little bit of water to do well, it does have a downside. All parts of these plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. This is a very different looking plant that I wouldn’t call beautiful and lush, but it is quite a conversation piece.
A Pencil Cactus plant requires very bright light and can even handle direct morning sun.
During the spring and summer allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. In the fall & winter water once a month. Pencil Cactus are very drought resistant, so when in doubt, do not water.
Feed at the beginning of spring and the beginning of summer with a balanced 20-20-20 fertilizer at 1/4 the recommended strength.
Likes warm temperatures between 65°-70°F (18.3°-21.1°C) during most of the year. In the winter, when resting, a Pencil Cactus prefers cooler temperatures around 50°F (10°C).
Basic household humidity
Mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids. Spray with my “Green Solution” (recipe in Glossary)
Pencil cacti are susceptible to phomopsis which is a fungal disease that causes gray “wart like” growths on the stems and root rot due to over watering.
Use a quick draining succulent or cactus soil to prevent over- watering.
A pencil cactus grows quickly and becomes quite a tall plant. It needs a good size sturdy pot and may need to be re-potted every year or two. Allow the soil in the pot to totally dry out before moving a Pencil Cactus to a new container.
Aggressively prune a Pencil cactus to keep it looking full. Always wear gloves and a long sleeved shirt when pruning the plant to prevent the irritating sap from getting on your skin.
A Pencil cactus is easily propagated using stem cuttings.
Pencil Cactus are very poisonous plants with a #4 toxicity level. The stems contain an irritating sap-like substance that oozes out of any cut or break in the stem. Not only should you wear gloves when working with a Pencil cactus , but you should wash your hands thoroughly with soap after removing the gloves. You don’t want to risk getting sap in your eyes or mouth.
After taking a stem cutting from a Pencil Cactus Plant for propagation, dip the cut end of the stem in fresh water to stop the flow of the latex, sap. Allow the cut end of the stem to dry out for a week until it forms a callous on the tip. When the Pencil Cactus cutting is ready, pot the cutting in moist sand or in some cactus soil.
Repotting a Pencil Cactus Plant is a little tricky because of the danger of root rot due to over-watering. You should only re-pot a Pencil Cactus Plant when it is really necessary and then only during the warm months. Be sure the soil is very dry before you start, then gently remove the Pencil Cactus from its pot. Brush off the soil from the roots and remove any dead roots. If you accidentally make any cuts in the stems of the Pencil Cactus, immediately treat them with a Fungicide. Put the Pencil Cactus in its new container and spread out the roots. Fill in around the roots of the Pencil Cactus with moist succulent or cactus soil. Allow the soil in the pot to dry-out for a week or so, then begin to water lightly to reduce the risk of root rot. Since the Pencil Cactus is in a larger pot, it will take longer to try out.
The leaves on the stems of a Pencil cactus Plant naturally fall off very quickly. You are not doing anything wrong. A Pencil Cactus usually just has its long thin cylindrical succulent stems."
56,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Lucky Bamboo Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/lucky-bamboo-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Lucky Bamboo plant is really made up of the cut stalks of a Dracaena Sanderiana and is native to West Africa and Eastern Asia. The Lucky Bamboo plant stalks are usually 4″- 24″in height. Followers of Feng Shui believe that the Lucky Bamboo plant brings prosperity and good fortune to a home or business. If the Lucky Bamboo plant arrangement has three stalks it supposedly brings happiness; five stalks bring wealth; and six stalks bring health. Four stalks are never allowed since the word four in Chinese sounds too close to the Chinese word for death. A Lucky Bamboo plant is considered to be slightly poisonous and should be kept way from small children and especially dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  If you buy Lucky Bamboo stalks loose and not planted, be sure to keep them in water until you have permanently placed them in a vase or decorative container.  If you purchase multiple Lucky Bamboo plant stems that are tied together, do not remove the ties, this stabilizes the plant. Lucky Bamboo plants require very little care and grow practically anywhere as long as you keep the water clean and chemical free. These plants also do well when planted in soil.
A Lucky Bamboo plant can survive in medium and even lower light, but does much better in bright indirect light. Pale leaves indicate the plant is not getting enough light. Avoid placing a Lucky Bamboo plant in the direct sun.
Watering a Lucky Bamboo plant takes a little time and care. Keep the marbles and pebbles in your vase covered with water at all times. Add water to the container weekly to keep the proper level. Once a month remove the Lucky Bamboo plant from the water, rinse the roots, pebbles, and marbles with fresh water, and then put the arrangement back together. Avoid using water high in fluoride or chlorine.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with an African Violet plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Excessive fertilizer causes the leaves to turn yellow.
Lucky Bamboo Plants do best in warm temperatures between 70°-85°( 21°-29°C)
Basic household humidity
A Lucky Bamboo plant produces flowers that only appear at night. The blooms are made up of many small flowers and have a slight scent.
A Lucky Bamboo plant attracts unwanted insects if placed outdoors but is pest resistant indoors.
Lucky Bamboo plants are prone to fungal infections that turn the stalks yellow and cause them to die.
Lucky Bamboo plants can also be planted in a loose quick-draining soil as well as kept in a vase of water. If using soil always allow the top few inches to dry out before watering.
When planted in soil, move a Lucky Bamboo plant to the next size pot, and nothing larger, once the roots have filled the existing pot.
Remove off-shoots to preserve the intricate shape of the plant; new growth develops from these cut areas. You can limit new growth by covering the cut areas with paraffin.
Propagate Lucky Bamboo using cane cuttings.
A Lucky Bamboo plant has a #1 toxicity level and is considered to be a mildly to moderately poisonous plant, especially to dogs and cats.
You can definitely try to cut the stalks of a Lucky Bamboo. and try to propagate the plant, but the success rate is less than 50%. Be sure to use a very sharp knife and cut below a joint in the stalk. Remove all but three or four leaves from the new stems before putting them in water.
Discoloration in the leaves of a Lucky Bamboo plant is usually caused by too much salt, fluoride, or chlorine in the water. Stop fertilizing and try using distilled water.
No, your Lucky Bamboo does not have the plant disease called rust. The roots of a healthy mature Lucky Bamboo plant are supposed to be an orange/ brown color.
A Lucky Bamboo plant will be okay for a while once the stalk turns yellow, but there is nothing you can do to prevent it from eventually dying. Cut off any healthy green shoots on the yellow stem and root them so you’ll have some new Lucky Bamboo stalks, then discard the yellow stem. Change the water your Lucky Bamboo Plant is sitting in and rinse the roots in case the old water had something harmful in it or too much fertilizer has accumulated. When you reset your Lucky Bamboo Plant in its container, use distilled water, be sure the pebbles are clean, and that all of the roots are in the water. Most Lucky Bamboo Plant problems are related to the water. Chlorinated or dirty water kills a Lucky Bamboo Plant."
57,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Schefflera Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/schefflera-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Schefflera plant, native to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is often called an Umbrella Tree because of its large, shiny, dark green leaflets that drape down like the spokes of an umbrella. In nature, the plant can be a tall tree or a short bush with woody stems, growing as tall as 10-50 ft. In some outdoor areas, a Schefflera is called an Octopus Tree because it produces impressive, tentacle like flowers.
The Schefflera actinophylla, sometimes referred to as Brassaia actinophylla, is the most popular large schefflera used as a houseplant. Each leaf grows at the end of a long stem and consists of several smaller leaflets. As the plant matures, the number of long, leathery, glossy, oval leaflets increases from 4 – 6 to 12 -16. The plant produces multiple, woody trunks and may grow as tall as 10-12 ft. Indoors, a schefflera rarely produces any flowers.
The newer Schefflera Amate, which is grown from a tissue culture, has larger glossier leaves, requires less light, is more resistant to spider mites, has a better developed root system, and is very symmetrical and full. A Schefflera Amate is a little more expensive than a regular schefflera, but well worth the extra cost.
The Hawaiian Schefflera, S. Arboricola, sometimes referred to as a “dwarf” schefflera, is a much shorter, bushier, compact variety with 1”- 2” leaflets.
Prefers bright light but no direct sun
Green leaves drop off and new growth turns black from too much water
Leaves turn yellow from not enough water
Prefers warm temperatures between 65°-80°F (18.3°-26.7°C)
Propagate using stem tips cuttings during the summer
Big dark brown and black spots on the leaves – Leaf Spot Disease
Tiny hard, light brown bumps and sticky residue on leaves – indicates a Scale plant pest problem
Fine webbing and pale leaf color –  Spider mites pest infestation
Light green rather than dark green leaves – plant needs more fertilizer
A Schefflera does well in medium light, but grows faster and develops more leaves in bright, indirect light. The Schefflera Amate variety needs less light than a regular Schefflera plant.
Allow the top 25-30% of the soil to dry out before watering. Green leaves drop off and new growth turns black when a Schefflera is over-watered. Yellow leaves indicate the plant needs more water.
Fertilize a Schefflera monthly during the spring and summer, when it is actively growing, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. During the fall and winter feed every other month when the plant is producing new leaves.
A Schefflera prefers temperatures between 65°-80°F ( 18.3°-26.7°C). They do not do well in temperatures below 55°F (12.8°C). Keep the plant away from cold drafts and heaters.
A Schefflera grows well in basic household humidity or higher. If the air is very dry, place your plant on a tray of small pebbles and water. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
An indoor Schefflera rarely flowers.
Spider mites, mealy bugs, aphids, scale, and fungus gnats an be a problem for a schefflera plant. Insect prevention is always easier than treatment, so examine the leaves of your schefflera time you water.
Leaf spot disease and powdery mildew may develop if the leaves stay wet. Read more about these plant diseases in the Glossary of the website.
A Schefflera prefers a well-aerated, fast-draining, indoor potting soil. Replace 1/3 of the soil with fresh soil every two years.
Schefflera plants can be purchased in 4″-14″ pots. When the roots have filled the pot, move the plant to the next size container and nothing larger. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can drain out.
If a Schefflera loses its bottom leaves or becomes leggy, don’t be afraid to aggressively prune the plant. When cutting back the thick stems or trunks, make the cut a little above a plant node. New growth will develop from these plant nodes.
Use stem tip cuttings, in the spring, to propagate a Schefflera.
A Schefflera plant is a slightly poisonous houseplant with a level #1 toxicity. It is toxic to cats, dogs, and small children.
A Schefflera plant becomes tall, thin, and spindly when there isn’t enough light and the plant is reaching for whatever light is available. The light green instead of the usual dark green glossy leaves indicates the plant probably needs more fertilizer. I’d aggressively prune the plant and move it to a brighter location. Once new leaves start to develop, feed it monthly with a basic houseplant food at ½ the recommended strength. If it’s not putting out new leaves, don’t fertilize.
Your Schefflera plant is over- watered and has probably suffered some root damage. Carefully take the plant out of its pot and replace the current wet soil with a well-aerated quick draining soil. Put your Schefflera plant in bright indirect light and don’t water for several weeks. After that, only water your Schefflera plant when the top 25-30% of the soil is dry.
The black and brown spots on the leaves of your schefflera plant are a form of Leaf Spot Disease. Cut off the diseased leaves and move the plant away from your other plants to prevent the Leaf Spot Disease from spreading. Keep the schefflera plant leaves dry, provide good air circulation around the plant, and cut back on your watering. If the disease doesn’t clear up you may have to purchase a commercial Fungicide or try the homemade remedy of putting a tablespoon or two of baking soda and a teaspoon or two of mineral oil in a spray bottle of water. Shake the solution well and spray all areas of the plant.
The “sticky stuff” is referred to as honeydew and it attracts the dark powdery residue called sooty mold. These two things usually indicate that your schefflera has an aphid or scale infestation. Spray the entire plant with the green solution (recipe in the Glossary) or Neem Oil every 10 days for a month. Be sure to concentrate on the new growth.
Webbing and pale spots usually mean your schefflera plant has a spider mite problem. Spray all parts of your schefflera plant with the green solution (recipe in the Glossary) and repeat the spraying every 10 days for a month. If that doesn’t get rid of the mites, you may have to buy a commercial mitacide. Spider mites appear when the air is very dry. Try putting a small humidifier near your plant or grouping plants together to increase the humidity in the area."
58,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Bird’s Nest Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/birds-nest-fern-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Bird’s Nest Fern, Asplenium nidus, is member of the Asplenium genus which contains hundreds of different fern species. It is native to the rain forests of Asia, Africa, and Australia which explains why warm temperatures and high humidity are essential for it to thrive. In nature, a Bird’s Nest Fern is an epiphytic plant or “air plant,” meaning it grows on other plants or tall trees. When new fronds first appear, they resemble little bird eggs which is how the plant got the nickname Bird’s Nest Fern.
This unusual  looking fern has long, erect, leathery, apple-green fronds that never split like those of a Kimberly Queen Fern or a Maidenhair Fern. The wide, rippled leaves of a Bird’s Nest Fern emerge from a central rosette or crown that looks like a fuzzy, brown funnel. The tongue- shaped fronds are fragile so try not to handle the young immature fronds and place the plant in an area where it won’t be bumped. Although in nature a Bird’s Nest Fern may have fronds as long as 5ft (1.5m), as a houseplant, the mature plant forms a compact, vase like shape with leaves not much larger than 24” (60cm) wide and 16” (40cm) tall.
Birds Nest Fern Varieties
There are several cultivars of the Bird’s Nest fern that make excellent houseplants.
“Crispy Wave” Fern has sword shaped, ruffled leaves.
Antiquum ‘Crissy’ has gently, wavy fronds that branch out at the end into crested divided leaf tips.
Osaka or Japanese Bird’s Nest fern has narrow, arching, leaves with very ruffled edges.
Asplenium nidus Leslie has very, very curly, parsley like crested frond ends.
Prefers warm temperatures 70°- 90°F (21.1°-32.2°C)
Keep soil barely moist and drier in winter
Avoid getting water on the center crown-it can cause plant diseases
Fertilize lightly – too much plant food is worse than too little
Do not use commercial insecticides and fungicides –  they damage the leaves.
Regular lines of brown spots on underside of fronds are propagation spores not signs of peats or diseases
High Humidity is a plus
A Bird’s Nest Fern is not an easy care plant and cannot be ignored like some other plants. Many people place this unusual looking fern in a bathroom other humid area which helps it grow a bit more quickly and keep its bright green color.
A Bird’s Nest fern requires medium, indirect light. The distinctive bright green leaves become pale when exposed to too much light. Direct sun causes unsightly burn marks on the fronds of a Bird’s Nest fern.
The soil of a Bird’s Nest fern should be kept barely moist but never soggy at all times.
Fertilize a Bird’s Nest fern once or twice during the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Over-fertilizing causes more problems for a Bird’s Nest fern than never fertilizing at all. Use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
A Bird’s Nest fern grows well when the temperatures is between 70°-90°F (21.1°-32.2°C) during the day and about 10° cooler at night. These slow growing ferns grow even more slowly when the temperature is not warm and the fronds are quickly damaged by hot or cold drafts. The base of the fronds of a Bird’s Nest fern turn yellow when the temperature is too warm.
Bird’s Nest ferns require high humidity. The higher the humidity, the longer the fronds grow; indoors this can be up to 24” and outdoors 4-5 ft. Lack of humidity causes major problems for a Bird’s Nest fern: the entire frond may turn yellow, the tips of the leaves may turn brown, and the plant may stop growing altogether. If the humidity in your home is very low, consider placing your fern on a wet pebble tray, be sure the plant is sitting on pebbles and not in the water. You can also place a small humidifier in the room.
A Bird’s Nest fern is susceptible to plant pests such as mealy bugs, scale, and aphids. Use a Qtip dipped in alcohol to treat plant pests near or on the crown; never spray any liquid directly on the crown. Use a chemical free product like Safer Insecticidal Soap if you need to spray the plant.
The leaves of a Bird’s Nest fern should be kept dry. Misting the plant encourages bacterial and fungal infections such as Erwinia Blight.
The soil for a Bird’s Nest fern should be loose, drain quickly, and. contain a large amount of organic material.
Once the roots of a Bird’s Nest fern fill the pot that its in,, re-pot to the next size container and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape. Never allow the plant posit in the excess water.
A Bird’s Nest fern is propagated using the spores that develop on the back sides of the fronds. Unlike other ferns, a Bird’s Nest fern cannot be propagated by plant division. Propagation is usually best left to the professionals.
Bird’s Nest ferns are non-poisonous houseplants and are not toxic cats, dogs, and other pets.
I’m guessing that the brown spots on the leaves of your Bird’s Nest fern are spores, which is how the plant propagates in the wild. If your Bird’s Nest fern really had the plant pest called scale, it would be all over the plant not just on the under-side of the leaves.
Translucent spots on a Bird’s Nest fern are caused by a bacterial plant infection. To treat this plant disease remove any diseased leaves, keep the remaining leaves dry, reduce your water, and keep your Bird’s Nest fern away from your other plants until the infection clears up (or the plant dies).
The leaves of a Bird’s Nest fern may lose their lovely wavy shape if the plant is getting too much fertilizer. Plant food should always be diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength for most houseplants but especially for ferns."
59,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/6,Fittonia,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/fittonia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide-nerve-plant/,,,"A Fittonia is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, especially Columbia and Peru. It gets its nicknames, Nerve Plant or Mosaic Plant because of the distinct, veined appearance of its beautiful, ornamental leaves. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and a close relative of the Zebra plant (Aphelandra). A Fittonia can be grown outside as a perennial, evergreen, ground cover in areas where the temperature stays above 40°F (4.4°C) even during the winter, and the dwarf varieties are perfect for terrariums. Nerve plants look beautiful and do exceptionally well, showing off their colorful vines, when placed in a hanging basket or decorative container in a brightly lit area of your home.
A Fittonia (Nerve Plant), is a small, compact, low-growing plant usually about 6”- 8” tall and 12”- 18” wide. This is a creeping plant with 2” thin, oval, leaves that have distinctive white, pink, red, or silver veins; the leaves are attached to fuzzy stems. Fittonia plants are usually divided into two groups based on the color of the veins in their leaves; white-veined fittonia belong to the Argyroneura Group while red or pink-veined fittonia belong to the Verschaffeltii Group. During the summer, if  growing conditions are excellent, a mature plant may send out 3” flower spikes topped with bracts of small, tubular, yellowish/white flowers during the summer. The brightly colored leaves of the plant are more spectacular than the insignificant flowers.
Fittonia verschaffeltii (“Painted Net Leaf”) has larger leaves than the common fittoni and pink veins
Fittonia Pearcei has green leaves with bright red veins
Fittonia argyroneura (Silver Net Leaf) has green leaves white veins
Fittonia argyroneura  “Nana” (Snakeskin Plant) has small 1” leaves with white veins
Fittonia “Black Star” has dark green leaves and dark, reddish purple veins
Fittonia “Fortissimo” is one of the larger varieties; the green leaves have pinkish-red veins.
Fittonia ‘Frankie’ is a unique variety with leaves that are more pink than green
        
Avoid cold drafts and overly wet soil in winter.
Minimum temperature 60°F (15C).
The brightly colored veins in the leaves fade in lower light.
Dilute plant food to 1/4 the recommended strength
Prune aggressively to keep a Fittonia full and bushy.
A Fittonia (Nerve Plant) grows well in bright and medium indirect light. It will survive and grow slowly in lower light but vibrant colors in the leave may fade.
Try to keep the soil of a Fittonia barely moist but never soggy. During the winter, water less and keep the soil drier.
Feed a Fittonia (Nerve Plant) only when it is actively growing and producing new leaves. Use a balanced fertilizer diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength.
A Fittonia plant prefers warm temperatures between 70°F-80°F (21°C-26° C) and does not do well in temperatures below 60°F (15°C).
Fittonia plants require prefer high humidity but still grow well in our homes.
If growing conditions are ideal, during the warmer months, a mature Fittonia plant may flower. The small, insignificant, tubular, yellowish/white flowers grow atop 3″ flower spikes. The brightly colored leaves of the plant are more spectacular than the flowers.
Fungus gnats, aphids, and mealy bugs can be a problem for a Fittonia plant. Read more about these plant pests and how to identify and treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Leaf spot, Mosaic viruses, and root rot due to overwatering are the main plant diseases that can affect a Fittonia plant..
The best soil for a Fittonia plant is a peat moss based potting soil that retains moisture but still drains quickly.
Re-pot a Fittonia plant annually, with fresh soil, once the roots have filled the existing container. Use the next size pot and nothing larger, and be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape. If the pot is too large, the soil stays wet too long, and the roots of the plant develop root rot.
Prune the leaf tips of a Fittonia (Nerve Plant) frequently to keep the plant full and prevent it from becoming leggy.
A Fittonia (Nerve Plant) is easily propagated using leaf tip cuttings during the late spring. Read more about propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
A Fittonia (Nerve plant, Mosaic plant) is a non-poisonous plant and safe to have around small children, dogs, cats, and other pets.
Constant pruning is very important to keep Fittonia houseplants looking good. Cut back existing stems to about 8″ above the soil line. This encourages the plant to branch out all along the stems. Once new growth appears, continue to pinch back growing tips once stems get about 6′-8″ in length. Move your Fittonia to a bright, humid, location. Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Fertilize every two weeks with a basic houseplant food at 1/2 the recommended strength once new growth appears, never fertilize if the plant isn’t growing.
Leaves fall a Fittonia or Nerve Plant when it is over-watered. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry out before watering. Move the plant to a warmer, brighter location so the soil in the pot can dry out faster.
The “black things” flying and crawling are Fungus Gnats. Fungus Gnats thrive in a moist humid environment so reduce the moisture in the soil, keep the leaves dry (no misting), and move the plant to a warmer brighter location. Place yellow sticky insect cards in the soil to trap the gnats. Keep replacing the sticky cards until no gnats appear on them."
60,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Philodendron Xanadu Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/philodendron-xanadu-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Philodendron Xanadu, sometimes referred to as Philodendron “Winterbourn”, is a large compact easy to grow plant. Each shiny, green, leathery leaf has 15-20 distinct lobes. A Philodendron Xanadu is often wider than it is tall, reaching a height of 2-4ft. and a width of 3-5ft in ideal conditions. The leaves of this beautiful, exotic looking foliage plant can be as large as 16″-18″ long and 7″-14″  wide. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  Unlike many philodendrons, like the Monstera Deliciosa, the Xanadu is an upright plant not a climber or vine. The best part is the older a Xanadu gets the better it looks.
A Philodendron Xanadu needs more light than other philodendron plants to maintain its compact appearance. It grows best in medium, indirect light. Too much bright light causes the leaves to become pale and bleached looking; too little light and the stems become elongated as the plant stretches towards the light. Direct sun burns the leaves.
Water a Xanadu thoroughly until the water drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot, and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Leaves turn yellow if the soil stays too wet. A Xanadu grows more slowly in the winter and requires less water.
Feed monthly in the spring and fall, every other week in the summer, and never in the winter. Use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the leaves are getting smaller and new growth is slow, the plant needs more food.
Daytime temperatures 75° to 80°F ( 23.9°-26.7°C); nighttime temperatures 65°- 70° F (18.3°-21.1°C)
Philodendrons like high humidity but still grow well in regular household humidity.
A Philodendron Xanadu attracts aphids and mealy bugs. If the air is very dry, spider mites are also a problem.
Bacterial diseases, especially all varieties of leaf spot disease, are a problem for the Philodendron Xanadu. Root rot from over- watering can seriously hurt the plant and cause the plant to die. Cool temperatures, dry leaves, and good air circulation helps prevent diseases.
Use a potting soil high in organic matter that drains quickly.
These plants like to be repotted as soon as their roots start to fill the existing pot. Use a a container that has drip holes in the botton and is about two -three inches larger than the root ball.
A Xanadu does not require much pruning. If the plant is getting too large and taking over your room, remove leaves by cutting them off at the base of their stem.
A Xanadu is propagated by plant division. Read about this type of propagation technique in the Glossary of the website.
A Philodendron Xanadu is a poisonous plant with a level #1 toxicity. Philodendrons are especially poisonous to dogs and cats.
A Philodendron Xanadu never needs to be pruned. The plant’s shape usually resembles a large mushroom cap. Keep a Philodendron Xanadu in good light so that it stays compact and does not become leggy and sparse looking.
Propagate a Philodendron Xanadu by simple plant division. Separate the plant and its roots into two sections, use your hand to gently pull the root ball apart, do not use a knife. Plant the Philodendron Xanadu sections in pots that are only an inch or two larger than the root ball to prevent over-watering and root rot.
There is a new variety called the Golden Philodendron Xanadu. The beautiful leaf shape is the same, but the color of the leaves goes from a glossy bright yellow to various shades of green.
A Philodendron Xanadu may get flowers especially if you put it outside in the shade during the summer. The flowers, however, are not very attractive. I‘d cut them off so the beautiful leaves can grow more quickly."
61,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Kalanchoe Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/kalanchoe-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"At one time, a kalanchoe plant was only sold as a flowering Christmas plant. Today kalanchoe plants are sold in bloom throughout the year and are one of our most popular indoor, flowering houseplants.  A kalanchoe plant, native to Madagascar, is a member of the Crassulaceae family and a close relative of the jade plant. This is an easy-care, succulent plant that grows extremely well in a bright spot in your home. Be sure to keep the temperature above 50° and be careful not to over water. Repot once the plant has finished flowering and has rested for about a month.
The kalanchoe “blossfeldiana” is the most frequently sold variety. This is a short, bushy, upright plant, about 12” to 18” inches tall and  6” to 20” wide , with thick, oval-shaped, scalloped leaves. The long-lasting, star-like blooms on a kalanchoe blossfeldiana appear in clusters at the ends of sturdy stems throughout the year. The vibrant colored flowers come in red, orange, yellow, lavender, white, and pink. Some new varieties even have bi-colored flowers. The kalanchoe “mangginii” has fleshy, rounded leaves, and produces large, bell-shaped flowers in bright red and reddish/orange during the spring. The leaves of both varieties turn red when the plant is in very bright light. Best of all, the blooms on kalanchoe plants may last up to 8 weeks. If you are quick to deadhead the plant (pinch off dead flowers), you’ll encourage the plant to bloom more often and produce a greater number of flowers.
K. Pink Butterflies (K. Mother of Millions) has hundreds of bright pink baby plants along the leaf edges that fall off and root.
K. Calandiva is in a type of  K.blossfeldiana but with larger and more beautiful flowers.
K. Albino has white scalloped leaves trimmed in pink
K. Paddle (flapjack paddle plant) has thick, leathery, paddle-shaped leaves. During the winter the leaves often turn bright red.
K. Panda has velvety, long, oblong leaves with brown decorative spots along the leaf edges.
K. Mangginii (Chandelier plant) has fleshy, rounded leaves, and produces large, bell-shaped flowers in bright red and reddish/orange during the spring.

A kalanchoe is a wonderful indoor plant to perk up your home during the long winter months. The shorter the days and the longer the nights, the more flowers a kalanchoe plant produces. Kalanchoes are also a perfect gift for someone who loves flowering plants but doesn’t have very much time to take care of it. Keep in mind, however, that all varieties of kalanchoe plants contain cardiac glycosides and are poisonous plants and must be kept away from small children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a kalanchoe plant: A kalanchoe plant needs bright, indirect light and can even tolerate direct sun during the fall, winter, and spring. Direct sun in the summer is too intense and burns the leaves. The blooms on a kalanchoe plant are photo-periodically induced. As the days get shorter and a kalanchoe experiences longer periods of darkness, the plant produces more flowers.
How to water a kalanchoe plant: The succulent kalanchoe plant has plump leaves that store water for long periods of time. These plants are easily over-watered which results in root-rot. Always allow the top 50% of the soil to dry-out before watering a kalanchoe. If the soil is exceptionally dry, sit the plant in a deep saucer of water for about ten minutes; this not only prevents over-watering, but keeps the leaves dry. Wet leaves encourage plant diseases such as leaf spot or powdery mildew.
How to fertilize a kalanchoe: Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing with a fertilizer high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the soil is very dry, moisten the soil with plain water before fertilizing; this prevents the plant food from burning the roots.
Best temperature for a kalanchoe plant: Indoor kalanchoe plants like warm temperatures between 60°-85°f (15.6°-18.3°c). Low temperatures below 40°f (4.4°c) can damage or kill a kalanchoe plant within a few hours. Keep these plants away from cold drafts and open windows during the winter.
Humidity for a kalanchoe: Kalanchoes grow well in regular to low household humidity. When the humidity is too high, these plants develop plant diseases such as leaf spot or powdery mildew.
Flowering tips: Removing faded blooms as soon as they appear encourages more flower development. Starting in October, keep a kalanchoe plant in total darkness for up to 14 hours a day. This encourages the plant to bloom even more.
Kalanchoe plant pests: A kalanchoe plant is fairly pest resistant. When placed outdoors for the summer, they may attract mites, scale, and aphids. These plants are very sensitive to chemical insecticides. When treating a kalanchoe for a pest infestation, use the “Green Solution”, yellow sticky cards, insecticidal soap, or Neem oil. You can read about all of these products and how to make the Green Solution in the Glossary of the website.
Kalanchoe plant diseases: A kalanchoe plant may get leaf spot disease and powdery mildew. The best way to prevent these plant diseases is to keep the leaves dry and provide good air circulation around the plant. Read more about how to identify and treat these plant diseases in the glossary of the website.
Best soil for a kalanchoe plant: Use a light soil composed of peat moss, sand, and perlite that drains well for a kalanchoe. When using a basic, store-bought potting soil, be sure to add an equal amount of sand for good drainage.
Pot size for a kalanchoe plant: Kalanchoe plants are sold in 4″ and 6″ pots. They rarely need to be in a container larger than 8” wide and 6” deep. Kalanchoe containers must have drip holes in the bottom so excess water can drain out. If the pot is too large and the soil stays wet too long, the roots die.
How to prune a kalanchoe plant: Remove dead or dying flowers as soon as they appear. Cut bare bare stems to keep the plant full and bushy.
How to propagate avalanche plant: Stem cuttings, plant division, and offsets are the best way to propagate a kalanchoe plant.When using stem tip cuttings, be sure to allow the cut end of the stems to dry out for 24 hours before planting them; this prevents the cuttings from developing root rot.
Kalanchoes need a month or two of rest starting at the end of September. Place your plant in a cool (around 65°f /18.3°c), low-light spot and keep the soil dryer that usual. After six weeks, return the plant to a warm, bright location and resume normal watering. This technique helps a kalanchoe produce more flowers.
Kalanchoes make great presents since, unlike cut flowers, they bloom for years.
A Kalanchoe is a poisonous plant and is toxic to cats and dogs. They belong to a group of plants that contain naturally-occurring poisons that affect the heart. The toxins in kalanchoe plants are similar to digitalis or digoxin, a common heart medication used in both human and veterinary medicine. The severity of the injury depends upon the amount of plant eaten. All parts of the plant are considered toxic, even the water in the vase of cut kalanchoe flowers is dangerous.
Kalanchoes do very well outside as long as you keep them out of the direct sun and out of the rain. Be sure to bring them indoors before the weather starts to get cold and check for bugs!
It sounds like your kalanchoe may have a fungal infection. Fungal infections are usually caused by water dripping on the leaves or very high humidity. Remove the diseased leaves, keep water off the leaves, increase the air circulation around the plant, and move your kalanchoe to a less humid location.
The best way to prune a kalanchoe is to cut the stems back to aabout 4″ above the soil line. After you prune the plant, place it in bright indirect light. It should become full and bushy in a short time.
Absolutely not! Do not throw out your kalanchoe once the flowers die. With proper care, kalanchoes bloom on and off all year for many years."
62,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Maidenhair Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/maidenhair-fern-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Maiden Hair fern, which originated in the Brazilian tropics, can be found growing in temperate climates throughout the world. The graceful, delicate fronds sometimes reach 20″-24″ in length and are covered in tiny, triangular, bright green leaflets called pinnae. During the spring, a Maidenhair Fern produces fronds that seem to have tiny dark brown “spots” on the underside of the leaf edges. The “spots” are really fern spores; this is how the fern propagates in nature. These specialized fronds do not live as long as regular fronds and if you don’t like the way they look just cut them off.  Although a Maidenhair fern does require more care and attention, with the proper care this plant can live for a long while, growing more beautiful with each passing year.
A maidenhair fern prefers bright indirect light but still grows slowly in medium light. It can handle early morning sun, but afternoon sun burns the fronds.
Keep the soil moist but not soggy and never allow it to totally dry out. If the soil is too wet, a maidenhair fern develops root rot and fungal diseases.
Feed every 2 weeks during the late fall and early spring (Sept-March) with a liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. These plants love fish emulsions a plant food.
Maidenhair ferns need consistent temperatures. They can handle warmth or cold, but prefer warm areas. Never place a maidenhair fern where the temperature fluctuates constantly.
As with temperature, consistent humidity is very important. Maidenhair ferns prefer high humidity but do not like to be misted. Placing them on a pebble tray filled with water is the best solution. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Dry air causes the leaflets on the fronds to shrivel.
Aphids, mealy bugs, and scale are attracted to these ferns. Rinse the entire plant in soapy water to treat a pest infestation.
Because maidenhair ferns like high humidity, gray mold can be a problem.
Use a very rich, quick-draining soil.
These plants like to be in a small pot. Don’t move a maidenhair fern to a larger pot until its roots have filled the existing pot.
Quickly remove any dead or dying fronds; they drain the plant’s energy and slow down growth.
In nature, maidenhair ferns are propagated by the tiny spores released from the underside of their leaves. Indoors, try plant division in the spring to start new ferns.
A maidenhair fern is a non-poisonous plant.
Maidenhair ferns need consistency and they don’t get it in the bathroom. After a shower the room is warm and humid, but the rest of the day and night it’s colder and the air is much drier. Find a spot where the temperature and humidity don’t fluctuate.
The tiny brown things are reproductive spores and are perfectly normal. The spores only appear on certain fronds so if you don’t like the way they look, cut off those fronds.
These ferns just don’t like being moved even if it’s from one good location to another. It will take a while for it to acclimate to its new home, so be patient, sooner or later it will start growing again."

A phalaenopsis orchid plant, also known as the Moth Orchid, is one of the varieties that does quite well. There are about 45 species in the Phalaenopsis genus and most are native to India, southern China, and Southeast Asia. A phalaenopsis orchid is a type of epiphytic plant which means, in nature, it grows on the trunks and branches of trees. As a houseplant, and with proper care, a phalaenopsis orchid plant blooms again and again for many years. It has become very popular because unlike other orchid plants, it has no resting period and may flower several times throughout the year.
In nature a phalaenopsis orchid plant sends out aerial roots so it can cling to trees, so as a houseplant most of its roots are above the pot and grow outside the container. This is perfectly normal so don’t cut them off.  Tall flower stalks grow out of the leaf joints and produce 3″-6″ wide, flattened flowers. The exquisite flowers grow in a line on long arching stems and can be yellow, white, pink, lavender, purple, cream, spotted, or striped.  They often last 2-3 months. The large, leathery, green, succulent leaves, as much as 18” long, are elliptic in shape and grow directly from the roots.
Phalaenopsis Orchid plants are a beautiful, inexpensive replacement for a cut flower arrangement or just an added delight for any room in your home or office. Now that they are being mass produced in greenhouses throughout the world, they are fairly inexpensive and easily available.
There is an orchid plant for almost any lighting condition, but none like being in the direct sun. If an area is too dark, the leaves turn dark green instead of the grassy yellow green they should be and the orchid plant doesn’t bloom. If there is too much light, the leaves turn yellow and develop sunspots. A location near an east or west-facing window is usually the best location. Most orchid plants prefer about 10 hours of light a day.
The easiest way to kill any Orchid Plant is by over-watering. Always allow the top 50% of the potting compost to dry out before watering. Check the roots of an Orchid Plant monthly to be sure they are staying whitish green and plump. Set the plant in a deep saucer of water for about 30 minutes so it can absorb water through the drip holes in the bottom on the pot. Use tepid water that has not passed through a softener (too salty). If your household water has a lot of chemicals in it, allow the water to sit out over night before using it. Type of soil, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence an orchid plant’s watering needs. Orchids dry out a little faster in the winter because of the heat in your home and low humidity.
Fertilize weakly, weekly when an orchid plant is actively growing. Dilute your plant food to 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength. Do not feed an orchid plant when it is dormant or when the plant is in bloom. There are excellent orchid plant foods on the market. You can also use a well- balanced houseplant food at 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength.
Orchid plants do well when the temperature is 65°-80°F (18°-26° C) during the day and 15° cooler at night. In the fall, cool night temperatures help the flower spikes develop. Once the orchid buds appear try to keep the temperature constant or the buds may fall off.
High humidity, 50% or better, is essential. Setting an orchid plant in a stand and placing the stand in a tray filled with pebbles and water helps increase the humidity. Be sure the plant never sits directly in the water.
Orchid plants usually flower from December-May and the flowers can last several months. The spectacular blooms can be as small as 1″ or as large as 5″ depending upon the orchid variety. Try not to get water on the flowers.
Aphids, scale, mealy bugs, and spider mites can be a problem. Good air circulation and near a small fan. The slight breeze also encourages flowers to develop faster. The best ways to treat any insects or pests is to dab them off with a Qtip dipped in alcohol or wipe them off with a soft cloth dipped in soapy water.
Orchid plants are prone to viruses, bacterial infections, and fungal infections. Increasing the air circulation around an is very beneficial in preventing diseases.
Orchid plants require a special soil and should never be planted in regular potting soil, it is much too dense. Use a bark-based or peat based soil that retains water, drains well, and allows the roots to “breathe.” Orchid plant soil should contain bark, sphagnum moss, and perlite. There are several commercial soils that are specifically for orchids.
Re-pot only if the potting medium has decomposed and is not draining quickly enough or if the orchid plant pseudobulbs have outgrown the pot. Remove the orchid from its old pot, shake off the soil around the pseudobulbs, place the plant in its new pot, and then fill in with the new potting mixture.
In nature, orchids get much of their food and water from the air, so never cut off any air roots that emerge from the soil. When the flower stalk turns yellow or brown, it’s time to prune. Cut the stalk back to about an inch from where it originated on the main stem. Use a clean razor blade or very sharp knife when pruning. Always remove any dead or diseased sections immediately, otherwise these sick areas of the plant attract more pests and diseases. Another pruning method for is to wait until your plant has finished blooming, look for tiny bumps or nodes on the flower spike. Find the third node from the bottom and cut the spike off 1″ above that node. Pruning an orchid plant helps the plant produce more flowers during the next season.
Orchid plants are propagated by plant division if they are sympodial, such as a Cattleya Orchid, or by stem cuttings if they are monopodeal, such as a phalaenopsis orchid. Read marabout propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Allvarietiesof orchid plants are non poisonous and safe to have around cat, dogs, and other pets.
Cut your Orchid Plant stem about an inch from where the flower stem originated on the main stem. Another pruning method is after the Orchid Plant has finished blooming, look for tiny bumps or nodes on the flower spike. Find the third from the bottom and cut the spike off 1″ above this node.
Leaves on an Orchid Plant usually become wrinkled when the plant is very dry and needs water. Alternatively, or you may have over-watered your Orchid Plant causing the roots to die, and now the plant can no longer absorb water. If the pseudo-bulbs of your Orchid Plant that are above the soil are shriveled, give the plant more water. You can also carefully take the Orchid Plant out of its pot and check the soil to be sure it’s not soggy at the very bottom. Orchid Plants do not like wet feet! Orchid Plant roots are healthy if they are greenish white and plump.
One of the main reasons an Orchid Plant doesn’t bloom is insufficient light. Start by moving your Orchid Plant to a brighter location. The leaves of an Orchid Plant should be a light to medium green color. Dark green leaves means an Orchid Plant needs more light. Orchid Plants also need a resting period for a month or so in a low light. cool area. While your Orchid Plant is resting, allow the soil to practically dry out before watering. This resting period helps an Orchid Plant go through the proper growth cycle. After about a month or two, move the Orchid Plant back to its previous spot in your home. Be sure to fertilize an Orchid Plant once it starts producing new leaves.
There are several things that cause bud drop on Orchid Houseplants. The first thing is check the moisture in the soil to see if you may be giving your Orchid Plant too much or too little water. The temperature of the location where the Orchid plant sits may be too hot or too cold. Try to keep the temperature above 55 degrees but below 80 degrees. Avoid placing an Orchid Plant near air conditioners and heaters and try not to move an Orchid Plant too often.
The amount of time an Orchid Plant blooms depends upon the species of orchid plant. A Phaleonopsis Orchid can bloom for 1-4 months while a Cattleya Orchid blooms for 1-4 weeks."
64,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Yucca Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/yucca-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The spineless Yucca plant, a native of Guatemala and southeast Mexico, is an ideal, easy care houseplant. Yucca plants can be a bush or a stalk plant.  The long, leathery, sharply pointed leaves of a Yucca plant are a foot or more in length and about an inch wide.  Yucca plants are very top heavy and should always be set into a heavy clay or ceramic pot to prevent them from toppling over. A Yucca plant is poisonous and should be kept away from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. A Yucca is the type of plant that complements a Southwestern look in your home or office.
Yucca plants grow best in bright indirect light. A Yucca can survive indoors in lower light but will need very little water. The slow growing yucca will be even slower to produce new leaves in low to medium light. An ideal location is near a west, east, or south-facing window.
A Yucca plant originates in the deserts of Mexico and Guatemala so it likes to be kept dry. Allow at least the top 50% of the soil of a to dry out before watering. Over watering is the main and probably the only way to kill a yucca.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a basic houseplant food at 1/2 the recommended strength.
A yucca can adapt to temperatures as low as 35° and as high as 90°.
Yucca plants do well in basic and even low household humidity.
Usual household plant pests stay away from a Yucca; even spider mites avoid this plant. If you do notice mealy bugs or scale, spray with the “Green Solution” (recipe in Glossary).
Use a good quality, well-aerated, loose houseplant soil that drains quickly for a Yucca Plant. Add sand to the soil if it seems too heavy or clay-like.
Yucca plants like to be root-bound in small pots.
If a yucca plant becomes top heavy and keeps falling over, cut the trunks off 1/2 way down. New growth will appear on the old trunk making it bushier and less apt to topple. Start new yucca plants using the sections of trunk that you cut off.
A yucca plant is propagated by stem (trunk) cuttings and offsets.
Yucca plants are slightly poisonous with a #1 toxicity level. The poisonous part of the plant is difficult to reach, but a persistent child or pet might be able to get through the tough exterior and eat it.
When the bottom leaves on a yucca turn light brown and crispy, it usually means the plant needs more water. Be careful not to over do it, but water your yucca a little more frequently.
My suggestion to help your yucca look better is to cut the main stalk off just above the new growth at the bottom. This will encourage lots of new shoots on the cane. Plant the green top section that you cut off, include about 12″ of the stalk, in the bottom of the existing pot. This Yucca cutting should root in about four weeks and you’ll have a great looking plant.
The stems, or stalks, of yucca houseplants get soft and mushy when they are overwatered. Take your yucca out of the pot, get rid of all the wet soil, and allow it to lay out bare root for a day or two. Remove all of the stalk above the mushy part of the stem. Repot in dry succulent soil. The pot should barely fit the roots of the plant. If the roots aren’t totally destroyed, your plant should start sending out new shoots in about a month."
65,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Lipstick Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/lipstick-plant/,,,"A lipstick plant is in the genus Aeschynanthus “pulcher” which means “pretty” or “beautiful” and refers to the vibrantly colored plant flowers. Just to confuse matters, a lipstick plant may also be classified as Aeschynanthus radicans.  Lipstick plants were originally found growing in the tropical and subtropical regions of Malesia and Indochina. Although a relative of the somewhat finicky African Violet plant, lipstick plants are easy care, indoor flowering houseplants that look beautiful hanging in a bright spot in your home. If you want a graceful, draping plant that blooms off and on all year, a Lipstick plant is a great choice. These plants do require a great deal of bright, indirect light and high humidity helps them grow even faster.
The leaves of a lipstick plant can be light green, dark green, mottled green, green, and maroon, or green with white streaks. Although the leaves are usually elliptically shaped, growing in pairs, and having smooth edges, certain varieties may have wavy, curly leaves. The distinctive looking flowers of a lipstick plant are how the plant got its name. The tubular flowers, which develop in clusters at the ends of the stems, look like tiny tubes of lipstick as they emerge from their dark maroon buds. Lipstick plant flowers can be bright red, orange, yellow, or pink. Although a lipstick plant can surprise us by flowering throughout the year, most blooms appear during the spring and summer. Flowers buds develop on the previous year’s growth, so keep that in mind when pruning the plant.
Lipstick Plant (Aeschynanthus radicans) know for its long, vines of thick, shiny, green leaves with maroon undersides and bright red, tubular flowers.
Black Pagoda Lipstick Plant (Aeschynanthus longicaulis) has draping stems of mottled green, semi- succulent leaves and tubular flowers in yellow, orange, and reddish orange.
Variegated Lipstick Plant (Aeschynanthus radicans ‘Variegata”) a stunning variety that has white streaked, variegated leaves and produces bright reddish-orange flowers.
Curly Lipstick Plant (Aeschynanthus radicans ‘Curly’) the most unique lipstick plant variety has dark green wavy, curly leaves and produces bright red, tubular flowers.
Mona Lisa Lipstick Plant (Aeschynanthus radicans ‘Mona Lisa’) has very dark green leaves and reddish orange flowers.

If you have a bright spot in you home or office and want a graceful, draping plant that blooms frequently, a Lipstick plant is a great choice. Hang a vining Lipstick Plant from the ceiling, place it in a wall sconce, or sit one on a table, you will love how they brighten your home throughout the year.
Lipstick plants require very bright indirect light but no direct sun.
Allow the top 25% of the soil to dry out before watering. If the leaves appear soft and shriveled, provide more water. Lipstick plants lose healthy green leaves when over-watered.
Feed every other week in the spring and summer, and monthly in the fall and winter with a plant food high in phosphorous diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
A Lipstick Plant grows well in temperatures between 75°- 85°F (24°-29°C)
Prefers high humidity but still does well in basic household humidity.
When placed in a bright area, a Lipstick plant produces small, reddish orange, pink, or yellow tubular flowers throughout the year. Stressing the plant by allowing the soil to dry out somewhat encourages the plant to bloom. Be careful when you prune, the new flowers on the the stems from the previous year.
Examine the plant every time you water for mealy bugs, spider mites, aphids, and thrip.
When placed in a humid area, a Lipstick plant may get fungal diseases such as leaf spot and botrytis. Keeping the leaves dry and providing good air circulation around the plant helps prevent plant diseases. Reach more about how to identify and treat leaf spot disease and botrytis in the Glossaryof the website.
Use a well-aerated houseplant soil that drains quickly
A Lipstick plant produces more flowers when kept in a small pots. In larger pots, the plant produces more leaves than flowers.
Trim long vines to prevent the plant from becoming thin and straggly, but always remember that flowers develop on the previous years stems.
Propagate a Lipstick plant using 4” stem tip cuttings from the newest vines. Read more about how to propagate a plant using stem tip cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
A Lipstick plant produces more flowers in the spring and summer if it has a “rest” during the winter. Move your plant to a slightly cooler area, keep the soil drier, and don’t fertilize until early spring.
Lipstick plants are not poisonous and are safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
To help a lipstick plant get flowers and bloom longer place it in bright indirect light, stress it by under watering a bit, feed with a fertilizer high in potassium, and keep it root-bound.
Thin and straggly lipstick plants need to be aggressively pruned and put it in bright indirect light.
Black spots on the leaves of lipstick plants usually indicate the plant has a fungal disease called botrytis. Quickly cut off the diseased areas before the botrytis spreads to other parts of the plant, and move your plant to a brighter, less humid location that has good air circulation. Keep the leaves dry and keep your diseased plant away from other plants. If the fungal disease returns, spray with a commercial Fungicide.
There could be a couple of reasons why an entire vine on a lipstick plant would dry up and die. First be sure the stem didn’t die because it is broken somewhere along the stem line. If that’s not the problem increase the humidity and give your plant a little more water."
66,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Crown of Thorns Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/crown-of-thorns-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Crown of Thorns plant, Euphorbia milii, or Christ Plant, is a bushy, slow growing, succulent plant native to Madagascar. According to legend, a Crown of Thorns plant got its nickname after it was associated with the Crown of Thorns worn by JesuOutdoors, in areas where the temperature stays above 55°F (12.8°C), this plant is a tall, woody, flowering bush with stems covered in sharp spines. It can sometimes reach a height of 5-6ft (1.5m-1.8m). A Crown of Thorns plant is one of the most popular types of indoor euphorbias, second only to the poinsettia.
As a houseplant, a Crown of Thorns plant can reach a height of 3ft (.9m) and a width of 2ft.(.6m). Like the outdoor variety, these plants have clusters of bright green, tear shaped leaves. The fleshy, dark brown stems are covered in sharp 1/2” thorns and a sticky substance that gets on your hands when you touch the plant. Like a poinsettia, the most beautiful part of a Crown of Thorns plant is the bright, colorful bracts that surround very small flowers. The bracts can be red, yellow, or pink and appear at the ends of 2” stalks. The more intense the light, the longer and more often a Crown of Thorns plant blooms.
Taking care of this plant is quite simple if you remember a few things:
Provide as much light as possible, but no direct sun.
Water less during the winter when the plant is not actively growing.
A Crown of Thorns plant likes warm in temperatures above 55°F (12.8°C)
Repot every few years in the spring.
Propagate using stem cuttings in the spring and summer
Quick Care Tips for A Crown ofThorns Plant
The unique and unusual looking Crown of Thorns plant is quite a conversation piece. It is an undemanding plant that thrives in very bright areas of your home and loves to spend the summer outside in a shady spot. However, it is a poisonous plant, and the milky, white sap is toxic to cats, dogs, and humans. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A Crown of Thorns plant needs as much bright, indirect light as you can provide,. Avoid placing the plant in direct sun which can damage the leaves.
During the late spring and into early fall, water a Crown of Thorns plant when the top 50% of the soil has dried out. Reduce the amount of water during the winter when a Crown of Thorns plant is not producing new leaves and flowers. Never allow the soil to totally dry out, or a Crown of Thorns plant may develop severe root damage.
Feed a Crown of Thorn plant monthly when it is actively growing with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Use a plant food low in nitrogen and high in phosphorous to limit leaf growth and encourage blooms on a Crown of Thorns plant.
A Crown of Thorns plant likes to be warm and does well in temperatures between 55° F (12.8C) – 95°F (35°C). A Crown of Thorns plant may lose leaves if the temperature goes below 55°F (12.8°C).
A Crown of Thorns plant is a succulent plant that stores water, so average to low household humidity is sufficient.
In the early spring through late summer, a Crown of Thorns plant produces colorful bracts in red, yellow, and pink surrounding tiny flowers. Under the right conditions, a Crown of Thorns plant will bloom all year.
A Crown of Thorns plant is very pest resistant. Mealy bugs and aphids are the main plant pests to keep an eye out for. You can read howto identify and treat these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Plant mildew and fungus are two plant diseases that can develop if the soil of a Crown of Thorns plant is kept too moist or if the humidity is too high. Plant diseases often occur if the room is cool and the light inadequate; so always provide good air circulation and warm temperatures for a Crown of Thorns plant.
A Crown of Thorns plant grows well in a sandy, quick draining soil that is 2/3 cactus mix or succulent plant soil and 1/3 perlite or coarse sand. The soil needs to drain quickly to prevent root-rot.
A Crown of Thorns plant should be reputed every 2-3 years during the spring. Move the plant to the next sized pot only and nothing larger.
Prune and shape a Crown of Thorns plant after it has finished blooming. Wear gloves and a long sleeved shirt to protect your skin from the poisonous plant sap.
Propagate a Crown of Thorns plant in the spring and early summer using 3”- 4” stem tip cuttings. Again, wear gloves to protect your hands from the sap that flows from cuts on the stem. Dip the Crown of Thorns stem tip cuttings in cold water and spray the trimmed areas on the mother plant with cold water to stop the oozing milky sap. Allow Crown of Thorns plant cuttings to dry out for a few days and form a callus on the cut end before planting them.
A Crown of Thorns is a poisonous houseplant with a level #2 toxicity. Broken or damaged leaves and stems ooze a milky latex substance that may cause blistering and pain if it gets on any open cuts. A Crown of Thorns plant is very toxic to small children, cats, dogs , and other pets. If consumed, it causes severe mouth irritation, gastro- intestinal problems, and even hemorrhages can occur.
The stems of a Crown of Thorns plant get mushy and the leaves turn yellow and fall off when the soil of the plant is too wet. Move your plant to a warm, bright location with good air circulation. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before you water again.
If you want to propagate a Crown of Thorns plant use stem tip cuttings that are about 3”-4” in length. This is a succulent houseplant so be sure to allow the ends of the stem tip cuttings to dry out for a few days and form a callus on the ends before planting them.
A Crown of Thorn plant needs as much bright, indirect light as possible in order to flower. Using a plant food low in nitrogen and high in phosphorous encourages a Crown of Thorns plant to produce more flowers than leaves.
The best way to prune a Crown of Thorns plant is to cut back a lateral branch to the height you want the plant to be. Wherever you prune, spray the cut with cold water to stop the latex sap from flowing. You can use 3 or 4 inches of the stem tip cuttings to start a new plant."
67,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Peperomia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/peperomia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"It is often hard to identify a peperomia plant since there are over 1000 varieties that  look quite different from each other. Peperomia plants are native to Central and South America, all  belong to the Pepper family, and are semi-succulents with very similar care requirements. One main difference is that those with thick leaves that store water are more drought resistant and forgiving if you forget to water than those varieties with thin leaves. Nicknames for the plant include Baby rubber plant, Pepper elder, and Radiator plant.
Peperomia plant leaves can be thick, plump, rippled, quilted, corrugated, smooth, hairy, or shiny; and can be various shades of green, red, gray, and cream. The pattern on the leaves may be marbled, striped, or a solid color. When small, peperomia houseplants can be used in dish gardens and terrariums. Indoors, mature peperomia plants rarely grow taller than 10”-16″ and are perfect sitting on a table or desk. Though usually an upright plant, some varieties make excellent hanging plants. Peperomia plant flowers are tiny and inconsequential, growing in clusters on upright conical spikes. They get the unpleasant name “rat-tail” flowers because of their appearance.
The most popular peperomias used as indoor house plants are the caperata and the obtusifolia varieties.
Peperomia Caperata Rosso is a dramatic looking plant. The dark green pointed leaves have red undersides; the top surface of the leaf appears wrinkled or corrugated. The very small, light green flowers appear in the spring and summer atop 2”-3” spikes.
Peperomia Icana (Felted peperomia) has round to oval, 2”-3,” gray green leaves. The leaves are covered in whitish gray hairs which gives the plant a fuzzy appearance. A peperomia icana has thick green stems with a touch of red.
Peperomia obtusifolia Variegata is a compact plant with shiny, leathery cup shaped leaves. The patterned leaves come in various shades of dark green, light green, and cream. It produces reddish brown flower spikes topped with tiny cream-colored flowers.
Watermelon Peperomia  (Peperomia argyreia) has oval to tear-drop shaped green and silver striped leaves with red stems. The small, inconsequential flowers appear at the top of thin flower stalks in the summer. flowers
Peperomia Tri Color (Red Edge Peperomia or Peperomia Ginny) has large leaves for a peperomia plant. The inner part of the thick leaves is green, and the leaf edges are bordered in cream and pink.
Other popular varieties include the: Peperomia Hope, Emerald Ripple, Raindrop Peperomia, and String of Turtles

“Rosso”                          “Icana”                      “Variegated”               “Watermelon”                   “TriColor”
Leaves lose color in low light, provide bright indirect light
Do not over-water, semi succulent Peperomia stores water in its leaves
Minimum temperature of 50°- 55°F (10°-12.8°C)
Do not rush to re-pot
Easily propagated using stem cutting in spring and summer
Water less and do not fertilize in the fall and winter
Peperomia plants are compact, easy care, semi – succulents that come in many varieties. Some varieties are small enough to planted in a dish garden, some are perfect as a table plant for a small area, while other varieties look beautiful in a hanging basket.  The very popular Peperomia plant was chosen as the  2022’s Houseplant of the Year by the National Garden Bureau’s annual “Year of Plants” program.
Peperomia plants grow well in the bright, indirect light provided by a west or east-facing window. These plants even grow under fluorescent lights. Insufficient light causes the slow growing peperomia plant to stop growing all together. Direct sunlight burns the leaves.
Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before you water. Over-watering, resulting in root-rot, is the main cause of serious peperomia plant problems. It’s best to water these plants from the bottom. This technique keeps the leaves dry and helps prevent plant diseases. The thick leaves of peperomia plants hold water and allow the plant to withstand long periods without moisture.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. It’s not necessary to feed a peperomia plant in the fall and winter.
Warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C) are best. Temperatures below 50°-55° F (10°-12.8°C) and cold drafts from windows and doors damage peperomia plant leaves.
Peperomia plants are originally from the rain forests of Brazil and like a warm, humid environment.
The flowers of peperomia plants are very small and inconsequential. It’s the leaves of certain varieties that are so interesting.
Houseplant pests such as mealy bugs and aphids can be a problem.
Ringspot, a virus that marks the leaves with unsightly round marks, develops in high humidity. Since there is no good treatment for this plant disease, damaged leaves and even the entire infected plant may have to be thrown out. Keep peperomia leaves dry and provide good air circulation to prevent diseases.
Use a well-aerated loose potting soil that drains quickly.
Re-pot peperomia plants to the next size container when the roots of the plant have filled the existing pot. Planting a peperomia in a pot that is too large prevents the soil from drying out quickly and causes root-rot.
Peperomia plants can be pruned anywhere along the stem. New growth develops from the nodes just below the cut in the stem.
These plants are easily propagated from leaf cuttings, stem tip cuttings, and plant division. Be sure to allow the cut ends of the peperomia leaves or stems being used for propagation to dry out for several hours or overnight before planting them.
A Peperomia is an non-poisonous plant.
The leaves and stems of a Peperomia plant contain alkaloids so the plant is considered a poisonous indoor house plant. Please keep peperomia plants away from small children and pets.
Peperomia plants usually start to lose leaves when the soil stays too wet.This is a semi succulent plant and does like dry soil.
Your Peperomia plant may be getting brown leaf tips because the temperature is too cold. Be sure your plantis not sitting on a cold windowsill or near a door during cold weather. Also, be careful with your fertilizer; too much plant food can cause brown leaf tips on plants. Feed a peperomia plant monthly in the spring and summer when it is actively growing, never in the fall and winter.
My favorite indoor peperomia houseplants are: Peperomia Emerald Ripple, a bushy table plant with quilted green leaves; Peperomia Cupid, a hanging variety; Watermelon Peperomia, a variety with grayish stripes on green leaves; and Peperomia obtusifolia, a Peperomia that resembles a baby Rubber Tree plant.
In cool weather, Peperomia plants need less water and no plant food at all. Cut back on your water, let the soil dry out, eliminate any plant food and move your peperomia to a warm bright location. Hopefully it will recover soon."
68,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Amaryllis,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/amaryllis-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Amaryllis plant is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and belongs to a very small genus of flowering plants that have only two varieties. The better-known variety, and the one we use  as an indoor plant, is the Amaryllis belladonna. This variety was originally found growing on the western cape of South Africa. Amaryllis Belladonia is sometimes called a Belladona Lily, Barbados Lily, or a Jersey Lily because the plant flowers look very similar to a lily. In Australia, an amaryllis plant is called an Easter Lily plant and in South Africa  is called a March Lily plant. This is because in the southern hemisphere, an amaryllis plant blooms around March in time for Easter. In the northern hemisphere, it  blooms in December and January in time for the Christmas and New Years holidays. Although the amaryllis plant  flower does resemble a lily flower both in the way it grows and in its shape, an amaryllis plant is really a very distant cousin of the true lily plant. Amaryllis plant bulbs can be planted (or purchased pre-planted) from October through the end of April. Those that bloom in late November, December, and early January are known as early or Christmas time amaryllis. The late blooming bulbs develop flowers in  late January and through March.
Amaryllis plant bulbs can be planted (or purchased pre-planted) from October through the end of April and will bloom anywhere from late November to January in the northern hemisphere. The spectacular amaryllis flowers range in size from 4”- 10.” When buying amaryllis bulbs, remember it is the large, healthy bulbs that produce the larger flowers. Amaryllis flowers can be singles or doubles and come in many colors such as red, white, rose, dark reddish/burgundy, orange, and apricot. New amaryllis plant varieties produce bicolored flowers and flowers with different edge colors. With proper after-bloom care,  the easy care Amaryllis plant will flower year after year for many years.

Once the flowers of your Amaryllis plant start to die, cut them off at the top of the stem, but do not remove the leaves on the stem.
Keep your plant in a bright spot and continue to water as needed.
When the stems begin to droop cut them back to the top of the bulb.
Continue to water and fertilize all summer or at least 5-6 months, allowing the leaves to grow; this provides nourishment for the bulb.
When the leaves start to turn yellow, prune the plant to about 2″ from the top of the bulb. This is usually during the early fall.
Remove the bulb from the soil. Clean the bulb and place it in a cool dark area, 40°-50°F (4.4°-10.0°C) for a minimum of six weeks.  The refrigerator is okay if there are no apples in it. Apples sterilize amaryllis bulbs and prevent new growth.
After the bulbs have rested, replant them and move your amaryllis to a warm, bright area. Plant the bulbs about eight weeks before you want them to bloom. It will take longer for an amaryllis to rebook in the winter than in the spring.
Amaryllis plants are considered very poisonous and should be kept away from dog, cats, and small children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
HOW MUCH LIGHT FOR AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Bright indirect but not direct afternoon sun is ideal for an amaryllis plant. Turn the plant each time you water keep the stems growing straight up and not leaning toward the light.
HOW TO WATER AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Water the bulbs sparingly until the stems appear. As the stem, flower buds, and leaves develop increase the water. Keeping the soil barely moist helps extend the life of the flowers.
HOW TO FERTILIZE AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Feed monthly with a plant food high in potassium and phosphorus and low in nitrogen. Always dilute the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength.
BEST TEMPERATURE FOR AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: These plants like temperatures between 68°-70°F(20°-21.1°C). Once the plant flowers moe it to a slightly cooler area to help the flowers last longer.
HOW MUCH HUMIDITY FOR AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Basic household humidity is all this plant requires.
You can plant amaryllis bulbs from late fall through the spring. The larger and healthier the bulbs are, the bigger the flowers will be (and the sicker your dog or cat with be if they eat one). Soak the base of the bulb and cheroots for a few hours before planting. It takes about 7-10 weeks from the time you planted the bulbs for an amaryllis to flower.
AMARYLLIS PLANT PESTS: Treat thrips and spider mites with the non-toxic homemade Green Solution, recipe is in the Glossary. Use Yellow Sticky cared to trap fungus gnats.
AMARYLLIS PLANT DISEASES :Fungal and bacterial diseases cause blotchy leaves. Provide good air circulation and keep the leaves of an amaryllis plant dry.
SOIL FOR AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Use a commercial bulb soil of a quick draining potting mixture. Try to find a sterile mix which will help prevent pest problems. Fill the container about half way with moist soil. Place the bulb or bulbs (1″ apart) on top of the soil. Add additional soil, but remember to leave about the top 1/4-1/3 third of the bulb above the soil line.
POT SIZE FOR AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: Like many houseplants, an amaryllis likes to be a little root- bound in a small pot. However, since amaryllis plants have tall stems and large flowers, use a heavy, wide pot that will help the plants grow straight up. There should be about 2″ of soil around the bulb. When planting multiple bulbs in one pot, place them about 1″ apart. If you are planting several bulbs in one container they can be planted about an inch apart.
HOW TO PROPAGATE AN AMARYLLIS PLANT: The best way to propagate an amaryllis plant is to use the offsets that develop around the base of the plant or to divide the bulbs. You can read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
A resting period for an amaryllis plant is very important if you hope to get it to flower again the following year. Following instructions above and you’ll have a beautiful blooming plant year after year.
Amaryllis plants are wonderful gifts especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
IS AN AMARYLLIS PLANT POISONOUS: This plant is extremely poisonous to small children, dogs, cats and other pets.. All parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can cause severe problems if the plant is ingested. The amaryllis bulbs contain calcium oxalates and are the most dangerous part of the plant. Pets that swallow pieces of an amaryllis plant suffer severe mouth pain, drooling, foaming at the mouth, vomiting, and breathing problems. Small children who eat any part of the plant develop digestive problems and swelling of the lips, tongue and airways making it difficult to breathe and swallow.
Here are a few reasons why your Amaryllis may not be producing flowers: Using the wrong plant food. fertilizers high in nitrogen help with leaf production but do not help flowers develop. Use a plant food high in Potassium. Your Amaryllis may not be getting enough light or the temperature may be too cold. The soil is too wet. If you dig up Amaryllis bulbs too early once the flowers fade; the plant may not bloom the following year.
The spots on the leaves, petals, and stems of your Amaryllis plant are caused by plant disease called red blotch. To eliminate red blotch, reduce your water, keep the leaves dry, remove any diseased leaves and petals as soon as they appear, and spray your plant with a commercial Fungicide.
Your Mom’s Amaryllis plant probably started out as large, plump bulbs while you bought small ones. The larger an Amaryllis bulb the more flowers it produces. Be sure to fertilize your Amaryllis while it is still a flowerless, green plant and give it plenty of very bright light.
An indoor Amaryllis plant rarely gets plant pests. If you put the plant outdoors when the weather gets warm, it may attract a few grasshoppers."
69,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/7,Strawberry Begonia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/strawberry-begonia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Strawberry Begonia plant, or Strawberry Geranium as it is sometimes called, is neither a begonia nor a geranium, but rather a member of the Saxifrage family. It does have bluish-green, fuzzy leaves like those of a begonia and it does spread by sending out “stolen” or “runners” like a strawberry plant; but a Strawberry Begonia is really an evergreen native to Asia and a close relative of the Piggyback plant. A Strawberry Begonia produces a lovely, white flower with pointed petals and a bright, yellow center. Like a strawberry plant, new babies develop at the ends of each of the “stolen.” Indoors or on your porch a Strawberry Begonia makes a beautiful hanging plant. Outdoors it can also be an excellent ground cover in your garden.
Place a Strawberry Begonia in bright indirect light. Direct sun burns a Strawberry Begonia Plant and puts holes in the leaves.
If the top 2”- 3” of soil in the Strawberry Begonia Plant are still moist, do not water. When the top few inches dry out, water a Strawberry Begonia until water comes out the bottom drip holes. A Strawberry Begonia Plant needs less water in the fall and winter when it is resting. Always water a Strawberry Begonia from the bottom so no water collects on the hairs of the leaves.
Fertilize a Strawberry begonia Plant monthly during the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a balanced indoor plant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not fertilize a Strawberry Begonia during the fall and winter.
Strawberry Begonias like cool temperatures and do not thrive when it is too hot. They prefer temperatures between 40-65 degrees(F).
A Strawberry Begonia does well in moderate to high humidity.
A Strawberry Begonia usually produces small white flowers in late spring or early summer.
Strawberry Begonias are fairly resistant to plant pests. If plant pests do appear, spray a Strawberry Begonia with an insecticidal soap such as Safer, at 1/2 the recommended strength.
Fungal and bacterial diseases can occur if water collects on the hairs of the leaves of a Strawberry Begonia. Keep the leaves dry and always water a Strawberry Begonia Plant from the bottom.
Use a a well-aerated houseplant soil that retains moisture but still drains quickly for a Strawberry begonia Plant.
A strawberry Begonia is a small compact plant that rarely gets taller than 12″; it does however send out numerous runners. Use a pot that is wider rather than deeper so some of the baby plants at the ends of the runners can plant themselves and grow near the Mother plant. Keep the plant a little root bound to prevent over watering.
Remove any yellow, dead, or damaged leaves from a Strawberry Begonia Plant as soon as they appear; if left on, dead leaves weaken the plant.
Strawberry Begonias can be propagated by plant division; but the easiest propagation method is to plant the tiny baby plantlets that grow at the ends of the runners. See full planting instructions in the FAQ section.
Like most plants, a Strawberry Begonia rests during the fall and winter.
A Strawberry Begonia is a non-poisonous houseplant. It is not in the same family as “real” begonias (which are ALL poisonous).
Your Strawberry Begonia is probably getting some direct sun and warm temperatures during the day. The sun put the holes in the leaves and the high temperatures caused the plant to wither. Move your Strawberry Begonia back inside to a cool low light area, continue to water until it starts to recover; then move it back into bright indirect light.
Strawberry Begonias have many names. Saxifraga stolonifera is its scientific name and the nickname “mother of thousands,” came from its many leaves. A few of its other names are Strawberry Geranium, Beefsteak Geranium, Creeping Saxifrage, Creeping Rockfoil, Strawberry Saxifrage, Magic Carpet, and Aaron’s Beard.
There are a couple of ways to plant these baby Strawberry Begonias. In either case, wait until the baby is a decent size and has several of its own leaves before propagating it. The first method is to cut off the baby with a section of its stolen (runner) and plant it in a small pot. The second way is to place a small pot of soil next to the mother plant and pin the baby down using a piece of wire or an open paper clip leaving the new plant attached to the original plant until roots develop. I always recommend using soil that is very similar to the soil used in the mature plant.
The round soft velvety leaves of a Strawberry Begonia can be solid green or can be green with prominent white veins, which is the variety you seem to have. There is also a variety that has white tips."
70,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Arrowhead Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/arrowhead-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Arrowhead Plant, also called a Syngonium or Nepthytis, is an excellent, easy to care for plant that originated in the rain forests of Central and South America. In nature, it is a woody, vining plant that can grow 30-40 ft (9-12 meters) long as it clings to the trunks of trees, climbing up to the sky as it reaches for the light. Syngonium podophyllum is the most popular variety grown as a houseplant and is in the Araceae family. Other popular houseplants in the Araceae family are the anthurium, caladium, calla lily, dieffenbachia, and pothos. All plants in this family are poisonous to small children and toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets.
Originally grown as a plant with solid green leaves, today there are multiple varieties and hybrids of arrowhead plants with leaves in many different colors. How much light each variety requires in order to grow well depends upon the color of its leaves. An arrowhead plant with solid, dark green leaves needs less light than a White Butterfly variety that has white and green leaves .
“White Butterfly” has predominantly white leaves with green accents
“Pink Allusion” comes in various mixtures of pink and bright green
“Strawberry Cream” has pale pink and green leaves
“Emerald Gem” has dark green and white patterned leaves
“Pink Spot” has white leaves with splashes on pink
No matter what type you select, the leaves of an Arrowhead plant always have a spade-like shape that resembles an “arrowhead”. The young, immature plant is short and bushy. However, as the plant matures and is not aggressively pruned, it produces long draping stems just as it does in nature. You can put the plant in a hanging basket or tie it to a trellis. If you want your arrowhead plant to be a large, full floor plant, cut back the long vines and keep pinching off the growing tips at the ends the stems. You can use the stem cuttings to propagate new plants.
Keep the plant in a warm area above 60°
Medium to bright indirect light
Keep the soil barely moist and drier in the winter
Propagate in the spring using stem cuttings
An arrowhead plant is very toxic to dogs, cats, birds, and small children. Please keep this plant out of reach! Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.

How much light does an arrowhead plant need: The leaf color of the plant determines how much light an arrowhead plant requires. Varieties with solid green leaves can grow in low to medium light. New arrowhead hybrids with white, pink, burgundy, and lime green in their leaves require medium to bright, indirect light.
How to water an arrowhead plant: Water well, and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Leaves may droop when the soil is dry, but the plant quickly perks up when watered. I like to water an arrowhead plant from the bottom to prevent over watering that can cause root rot.
How much fertilizer does an arrowhead plant need: Fertilize every two weeks in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed an arrowhead plant monthly in the fall and winter.
Best temperature for an arrowhead plant: These plants grow well when the temperature is 60°-70°F (15.5°-21.1°C). Avoid placing an arrowhead plant near heating vents, air conditioners, cold drafts, and fireplaces.
Does an arrowhead plant need high humidity: Although a location having high humidity, an arrowhead plant still grows well in basic household humidity.
Arrowhead plant pests: Scale and mealy bugs can be a problem, but it is spider mites that do the most damage. Spider mites suck the color out of the leaves and ruin the appearance of an arrowhead plant. Spray often with the “Green Solution” (recipe on how to make this inexpensive, non-toxic spray is in the Glossary of the website). See pictures of plant pests and learn how to treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Arrowhead plant diseases: Bacterial root rot due to over-watering and bacterial leaf spot disease that causes brown spots trimmed in yellow on the leaves are the main plant diseases affecting an arrowhead plant. Learn how to identify and treat leaf spot disease in the Glossary of the website.
What is the right soil for an arrowhead plant: The best soil to use is a rich, organic mix that drains quickly. I find that a soil made for African Violet plants is a good choice.
When to repot an arrowhead plant: Wait until the roots of the plant have filled the existing pot before moving it to the next size container and nothing larger. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot so that excess water can escape. Never allow an arrowhead plant to sit in the excess water.
How to prune and arrowhead plant: Aggressively prune the stem tips and long vines to keep the plant full and bushy. If you want to hang the plant, allow a few of the stems to keep growing. Since an arrowhead plant is a very poisonous, wear gloves and a long sleeve shirt when pruning the plant.
How to propagate an arrowhead plant: Use stem cuttings and plant division for propagation. You can read more about how to propagate plants using cuttings dividing the root ball in the Glossary of the website.
Is an arrowhead plant poisonous: This plant has a #2 toxicity level which means it is very toxic to dogs, cats, and small children. All parts of the plant contain calcium oxalates which, if ingested, cause swelling of the lips, mouth, tongue, and airways. This swelling makes breathing very difficult.
 
Prune an arrowhead plant by cutting the long vines of the plant to within 6-8 inches of the soil line. Shortening the long vines helps the plant become full and bushy. You should also pinch off the growing tips a few times a year.
The new leaves on your arrowhead plant are green because it’s not getting enough light. Green and white arrowhead plants, or nepthytis as they are sometimes called, need more light than solid green arrowhead plants.
There are a few reasons why the edges on the leaves of an arrowhead plant turn brown. Too much plant food: over-fertilizing a houseplant cause salts to build up in the soil and these salts cause leaf burn. Too much salt or chemicals in the water you’re using. Never use water that has passed through a water softener. Insufficient humidity around the plant is another cause of brown leaves. Try using distilled water and see if that helps with the brown leaf edges. To increase humidity around the plant, group plants together, place the plant on a wet pebble tray, or put a small humidifier in the room.
Your Aarowhead plant has a plant pest called spider mites. Spray all parts of the plant with the “ green solution,” Make a solution using 8oz. water & 8oz. alcohol, add two tablespoons of biodegradable soap and two tablespoons of mineral oil. Spray all areas of the plant. Use this solution on leathery leafed plants (except palms), never on fuzzy leafed plants like African aiolets or begonias. For palms, omit the alcohol from the green solution. Never spray a plant that’s sitting in the sun or one with very dry soil
It’s normal for a few older leaves on an arrowhead plant to turn yellow. If you are getting a lot of yellow leaves, check how wet you are keeping the soil. Be sure to allow the top 50% or so to dry out and the leaves get a little soft and droopy before watering."
71,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Split Leaf Philodendron Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/split-leaf-philodendron-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The tropical Split Leaf philodendron plant is often called, mixed up with, and interchanged with a Monstera deliciosa plant or Swiss cheese plant. Although both plants are in the same large Araceae family, have the same care requirements, and grow in a similar manner, they are not the same plant. The Split Leaf philodendron plant is a close relative of the pothos plant. The Monstera deliciosa, found in Mexico and often grown for its “breadfruit,” is a close relative of the Peace Lily plant (Spathiphyllum).
A Split Leaf philodendron, sometimes called a Lacy Tree philodendron or Horsehead philodendron, is a very large, popular, easy- care houseplant. These plants have big, glossy, leathery, heart- shaped leaves that, as the plant matures, split from the leaf edge to the center vein. The slits in the leaves of a Split Leaf philodendron are called cuts. When young, a Split Leaf philodendron plant has strong upright stems. As the plant grows larger and the leaves get bigger and heavier, the philodendron stems start to droop down until they are almost horizontal to the ground. A Split Leaf philodendron grows rapidly indoors, especially if the humidity is high, and often has leaves that are as large as 3ft. long and 2ft. wide.  When grown as a houseplant, it takes about 15–20 years for a Split Leaf philodendron plant to produce flowers. Eventually, an indoor Split leaf philodendron plant grows to be about twice as wide as it is tall and takes up quite a bit of space in your home or office.
 
                    
Monstera deliciosa      Swiss Cheese Plant     Variegated Split Leaf Philodendron
The leaves, stems, and roots of a Split Leaf philodendron contain oxalic acid and the plant is considered very poisonous. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. If you want a big, tropical, low maintenance plant and have plenty of room, a Split Leaf philodendron plant is perfect.
A Split leaf philodendron needs medium to bright light. It can survive in lower light, but the leaves won’t split and the plant becomes leggy. Keep it out of the direct sun.
Water a Split leaf philodendron well, until the water drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Allow the top 25-30% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Keep the soil of a Split leaf philodendron damp but never soggy. Water droplets or perspiration on the leaves of a Split leaf philodendron indicate over-watering; brown leaf edges indicate under- watering.
Feed a Split leaf philodendron every two weeks when the plant is actively growing with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
A Split leaf philodendron plant prefers warm temperatures and doesn’t do well in temperatures below 50°F (10°C) .
High humidity helps a Split leaf philodendron grow faster, but the plant can adapt to household humidity.
A Split leaf philodendron usually takes about 15-20 years to flower indoors.
Split leaf philodendrons are fairly immune to plant pests; but If mealy bugs, spider mites, aphids, or scale appear, use the Green Solution (recipe in Glossary).
Because of the high humidity a Split leaf philodendron prefers, bacterial diseases such as Erwinia Blight, Xanthomonas leaf spot, and leaf tip burn can be a problem.
Split leaf philodendron grows well in a rich soil that contains a good amount of peat moss and drains quickly. Using this type of soil prevents root rot.
Unlike most indoor plants, a Split leaf philodendron prefers to be in a large pot. Using bigger pots promote larger philodendron leaves.
Try to keep the large, shiny leaves of a Split leaf philodendron clean and dust free. This plant needs to be aggressively trimmed or it will take over your room.
The best way to propagate a Split leaf philodendron is by stem cuttings. Be sure to include a few leaves and a few plant nodes on each stem cutting and to allow the cutting to sit out over night before planting them; this helps prevent the developing roots from rotting.
A Split leaf philodendron is very poisonous houseplants with a #2 toxicity Level.
Brown leaves and edges on a split leaf philodendron usually mean that the plant needs more water, especially in the warm weather; or more humidity, especially in the winter when the heat is on. Keep the soil a little moist but never soggy. To increase the humidity, you may have to put your plant on a tray of pebbles filled with water (be sure the plant sits on the pebbles and not in the water), use a humidifier near the plant, or group three or four plants together to increase the humidity.
Sounds like your split leaf philodendron is over watered. Reduce your water and move the plant to a brighter, warmer location so the soil has a chance to dry out faster.
Leaves are small and don’t develop splits, or cuts as they are sometimes called, occurs when the plant is not getting enough light. Move the plant closer to a window but avoid direct sun.
I think the long, brown stem-like things you are referring to on your split leaf philodendron are air roots. In nature, these air roots help support the very weak-stemmed split leaf philodendron. You can plant them in the soil to give the plant more stability or but cut them off if you find them too unattractive.
A split leaf philodendron likes to have plenty of room for its roots. Larger pots encourage larger leaves. If you want your split leaf philodendron to keep getting larger, repot annually. If you want to limit the size of your plant, stop repotting it."
72,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Philodendron Congo Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/philodendron-congo-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Philodendron Congo is one of several cultivars of Philodendron that has been developed by growers over the last few years. This is a plant that can adapt to all kinds of conditions as long as you keep it warm. Its care instructions can be used for the following other Philodendron hybrids: Imperial Red, Black Cardinal, Moonlight, Red Emerald, and Autumn. Many philodendrons are climbers, but not this one. A Philodendron Congo is a self-header that spreads outward as it grows upward. The glossy, dark green, thick leaves are spaced very close to each other on a single stem. The stiff, barely visible stem, keeps a Philodendron Congo upright and elegant looking as it matures. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. This is an easy to grow plant if you don’t over- fertilize or over- water.
A Philodendron Congo can grow almost anywhere except in the direct sun. In low light the plant often looks stretched out as it tries to reach for the light.
Always allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering a Philodendron. When watering, cover the entire surface to prevent leaf problems because of dry soil areas.
Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing with a balanced food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the plant is not producing new leaves, it doesn’t need plant food.
Philodendron Congos grow well in normal household temperatures between 70°-85°F (21.1° 29.4°C). Keep these plants away from cold drafts and air conditioners.
Higher humidity is a plus, but philodendrons do well in basic household humidity.
Aphids and mealy bugs
Although high humidity helps a Congo grow well, it also encourages Erwinia Blight.
Use a rich quick-draining soil for philodendrons. You may have to add a little sand to your usual soil mix.
A Philodendron Congo is usually found in 6”, 8”, and 10” containers. They are slow growers and do not need frequent repotting.
A Philodendron Congo rarely needs pruning.
Growers use tissue cultures to propagate this Philodendron hybrid. You can use off- shoots or air layering if you want to try to propagate a Congo.
A Philodendron Congo is a poisonous houseplant with a #2 Toxicity Level.
Philodendron plants are very poisonous houseplants and will definitely make a small dog very ill.
Aside from looking unattractive, the mold growing on your Philodendron plant soil won’t hurt anything. Mold develops when the soil is being kept too wet. Cut back on your water and see if that helps get rid of the mold or change the potting soil.
Your philodendron plant is not getting enough light. Move the plant to a brighter location, but not into direct sun, and I’m sure it’ll improve.
A Philodendron Congo is a type of self-heading plant, not a vine. It really can’t be trained to grow on a trellis.
Poor leaf color on a Philodendron occurs when the plant gets too cold, when it’s sitting in the direct sun, or if it’s getting too much fertilizer.
Plant leaf tips usually turn brown from too much fertilizer. The high salt concentration in plant food burns the leaf tips. Water that passes through a water softener and becomes salty or water that is high in chlorine or fluorine can also cause brown tips."
73,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Jasmine Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/jasmine-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Jasmine plants are very fragrant, flowering plants that originated in China and the tropical areas of Asia. The buds of a jasmine plant are often more fragrant than the flowers.  Jasmine plants have shiny, oval leaves and white, pink, or pale yellow tubular flowers.  The Jasmine “polyanthum” variety is a twining, climbing plant with long, slender, trailing stems and is one of the easiest varieties to grow indoors. Another good indoor variety is Jasminum “sambac” or “Maid of New Orleans.” Under the right conditions, high humidity and very bright light,  jasmine plants will bloom several times a year, filling your home with a beautiful scent.
        
J.polyanthum      J.Night Blooming     J. Confederate            J. Arabian Sambac
A jasmine plant likes bright indirect light throughout the year, and in the winter benefits from a few hours of direct sun. However, avoid putting a jasmine plant in the direct sun during the summer, the intensity of the sun will burn the leaves. Try moving your jasmine plant outside for the summer, the plant will love it.
Jasmine plants loses leaves and leaves dry up from both too much and too little water. In the spring and summer, keep the soil moist but never soggy. The top 30% of the soil should dry out before watering. Soil that stays too wet, too long, damages the roots of the plant and eventually prevents the roots from absorbing water at all. When you do water, water well enough so that the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Do not allow the plant to sit in this excess water. During the fall and winter, keep a jasmine plant on the drier side.
Feed a jasmine plant every 2-4 weeks from March-August when the plant is actively growing. Do not feed during the fall and winter when the plant is dormant. Jasmine plants prefer a water soluble plant food high in phosphorous and low in nitrogen. This type of fertilizer helps produce more flowers.
Jasmine plants do well in cool rooms where the temperature is 65°-70°F (18.3°-21.1°C) and the light is very bright. If the room is too warm, a jasmine plant grows but doesn’t produce any flowers. These plants, like most houseplants, do poorly when placed near heaters, hot air vents, and fireplaces.
These plants thrive in high humidity. You can place a jasmine plant on a wet pebble tray (be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water), put a small humidifier near the plant, or group your plants together to increase the humidity.
Like poinsettias and Christmas cactus, jasmine plants need cool temperatures and short days to set their fragrant flower buds. In the late fall, temperatures at night should be 45°-55°. During the day, keep the plants in very bright light. At night, try to keep the plant in total darkness. An indoor jasmine plant usually flowers in January and February.
Jasmine plants attract aphids, mealy bugs, scale, and spider mites.
Since these plants like high humidity and moist soil, fungal diseases can be a problem. Keeping a jasmine plant in very bright light helps prevent some of these diseases, as does good air circulation and dry leaves.
Jasmine plants grow well in a basic houseplant soil that drains well but still retains water. Twice a year add some lime, as a supplement, to the soil.
The plant produces more flowers when it is root-bound. If the soil is drying out in just 2-3 days, it may be time to move your plant to the next size pot.
Prune a jasmine plant after it has finished blooming to maintain its size and shape. Never prune after the beginning of August since this is when a jasmine plant starts to set its flower buds.
Propagate a jasmine plant from stem cuttings in the spring. Rea more about propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
The flowers of a true jasmine plant (Oleaceae) are nontoxic. The flowers of the false jasmine plant (Loganiaceae) such as Yellow Jasmine or Carolina Jasmine are very poisonous. If you are unsure whether you have a true or false jasmine plant always err on the side of caution and keep the plant away from children and animals.
Jasmine Plants need more than bright light in order to bloom. Starting in October and for the next 6-8 weeks, keep your Jasmine Plant in total darkness from sunset to sunrise. The temperature where you keep your Jasmine Plant during this time should be between 40-50 degrees. These conditions help set the buds on a Jasmine Plant.
The ideal time to prune a Jasmine Plant is right after it has finished blooming in the winter. You can continue to prune a Jasmine Plant until August when all pruning should stop. The more you prune a Jasmine Plant, the bushier it becomes.
The discoloration and marks on the leaves of your Jasmine Plant is because you are keeping the soil too wet. The soil of a Jasmine Plant should be moist but not soggy. Always allow the top 1/2 to 1 inch of soil to dry out before watering a Jasmine Plant.
There could be two reasons why the leaves of your Jasmine Plant are drooping. Jasmine Plant leaves droop if the plant is getting too much direct sun. This can easily occur if a Jasmine Plant sits in a window with a western exposure during the summer. Try moving your Jasmine Plant to an area where it will get bright but no direct sunlight. The second reason for droppy leaves on a Jasmine Plant is more serious. You may have over- watered your Jasmine Plant and killed the roots."
74,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Norfolk Pine,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/norfolk-pine-how-to-grow-care-star-pine/,,,"A Norfolk Pine, Araucaria heterophylla, sometimes called a Star Pine, or a Norfolk Island Star Pine, is a stately, symmetrical evergreen tree that thrives indoors in very bright light. Despite the name Norfolk Pine, the plant is not really a type of pine at all, it is a conifer member of the Araucariaceae family. The plant got its nickname Norfolk Island Star Pine because the tree is native to Norfolk Island, a territory of Australia located in the Pacific Ocean. Many people use the plant as a living Christmas tree, but be careful not to dry out the branches with too many lights. A Norfolk Pine come small enough to sit on a table and large enough to fill the corner of a large room with tall ceilings. When purchasing one as as a houseplant, try to find a plant with multiple trunks so that it will stay bushy and full as it matures.
In nature the Norfolk Pine can grow as tall as 200 feet (60 meters), and the trunk can be as large as 10ft (3 meters) in diameter. As a houseplant, a Norfolk Pine can be small enough to sit on a table or big enough to fill the corner of a large room with tall ceilings. When grown indoors, it rarely gets taller than 9ft. When purchasing a Norfolk Pine, try to find a plant with multiple trunks so that it will stay bushy and full season after season. The branches are arranged in a perfectly symmetrical design and the trunks grow straight up. A mature Norfolk Pine has tiered, almost triangular branches covered in hundreds of bright green, needle-like leaves. A healthy plant, grown in bright light, has branches that are densely foliated, over lapping each other in a whirled pattern. Keep in mind, you can’t trim a Norfolk Pine or make it shorter without the tree losing its symmetrical shape. The nickname, Star Pine, comes from the way new growth develops at the top of the stem, emerging as a perfectly shaped star.
Provide bright indirect light and turn frequently for a compact, symmetrical-looking plant
Cool temperatures between 60-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C).
Never allow the soil to totally dry out.
The major problem a Norfolk Pine experiences as a houseplant is leaf drop and bottom leaves dying. This is caused by the soil drying out too much, little or no light reaching the bottom branches, or hot, dry air. Keep your Norfolk Pine root bound if you want to restrict the size. These plants are not considered poisonous; however, if a child or pet eats the pine needles it will cause severe stomach problems. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a Norfolk Pine: A Norfolk Pine requires very bright light, even some direct, morning sun. Bottom branches die and fall off when the plant doesn’t get enough light. Turn the plant weekly so all parts of a Norfolk Pine are exposed to bright light and the plant grows symmetrically.
How to water a Norfolk Pine: Keep the soil of a Norfolk Island Pine barely moist at all times. Yellow needles indicate that the soil is either too wet or too dry. If the soil of a Norfolk Pine completely dries out, entire fronds turn gray, brittle, and fall off.
How to fertilize a Norfolk Pine: Feed every other week during the spring, summer, and fall. Use a well- balanced, liquid fertilizer for acid loving plants diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not feed a Norfolk Pine during the winter.
Best temperature for a Norfolk Pine: A Norfolk Pine prefers cool temperatures between 60-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C) but will survive temperatures as low as 40°F (4.4°C) for brief time. Keep the plant away from cold drafts, air conditioning vents, and heating vents.
Humidity for a Norfolk Pine: High humidity is important. Dry air causes the needlelikeyeaves to drop off.
Norfolk Pine plant pests: The main insect to look out for is the Mealy Bug. You can recognize the problem by the white, sticky, cottony, residue these pests leave on the plant. Other insects that can infect a Norfolk Pine are scale, spider mites, Aphids, and whitefly. Read more about each of these plant pests and how to identify and treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Norfolk Pine plant diseases: When overwatered, a Norfolk Pine develops roots rot. The branches of the tree turn yellow or brown. If the watering problem is not immediately fixed, the plant will die. n bright indirect light, and keep the soil barely moist at all times.
Best soil for a Norfolk Pine: Use an indoor potting soil that retains moisture but still drains well for a Norfolk Pine. If the soil does not contain peat moss, add some.
Best pot size for a Norfolk Pine: Don’t be in a rush to repot a Norfolk Pine; they like to be root-bound. These plants are slow growers and usually need a larger container about every 2-3 years when their roots have filled the container they are in. The best time to repot a Norfolk Pine is in the spring.
How to prune a Norfolk Pine: A Norfolk Island Pines does not need to be shaped. Remove any dead branches from the bottom of the tree as soon as they appear. Do not cut off the growing point at top of the stem; doing this will destroy the beautiful. symmetrical shape of the plant.
How to propagate a Norfolk: A Norfolk Pine can be propagated using seeds but it is quite difficult. If your plant is thin and straggly and you to get rid of the old plant and start a new plant, cut 4″ off the top of the stem. This includes the star shaped foliage that gives the tree its nickname, Star Pine. Plant the cutting in a small container of rich potting soil, place the pot in indirect light, and keep the soil barely moist at all times.
A Norfolk Pine makes a wonderful living Christmas Tree. If you put lights and decorations on the tree, check the soil frequently since Christmas lights make the soil dry out faster.
Although not considered poisonous, if the needles of a Norfolk Pine are ingested by pets or children, they cause severe stomach irritation. I’d recommend keeping this plant far away from children and pets especially around Christmas when things are hectic and accidents happen.
The bottom branches of your Norfolk Pine are dying from lack of light. As the plant grows, the large upper branches shade the lower ones. Move your Norfolk Pine to a spot where the bottom branches are in the sun part of the day. Sadly, the bottom branches will never grow back once they have fallen off.
Cutting off the top few feet of your Norfolk Pine will destroy the beautiful symmetry of the tree. My best suggestion is to cut off the very tip of the new growth, where the star cluster of foliage is, and four adjoining inches of trunk. Plant the cutting in a small pot, moisten well, and place it in a plastic bag for a few weeks while it develops roots. Your existing Norfolk Island Pine will never look quite as good again, but you will have a new plant to eventually replace it.
Norfolk Pines are a type of evergreen, but can only be planted outside under very specific conditions. They need a very bright sunny spot where the temperature never goes below freezing and the humidity is very high.
The needles on the branches of a Norfolk Island Pine usually turn brown when there is not enough humidity and the air is very dry. These plants grow much better in high humidity. Try grouping your Norfolk Pine with other houseplants. Grouping plants together creates a mini greenhouse effect. You can also place a cold air humidifier nearby to increase the humidity. Don’t try to solve the humidity problem by allowing your Norfolk Pine to sit in water."
75,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Philodendron Xanadu Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/philodendron-xanadu-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Philodendron Xanadu, sometimes referred to as Philodendron “Winterbourn”, is a large compact easy to grow plant. Each shiny, green, leathery leaf has 15-20 distinct lobes. A Philodendron Xanadu is often wider than it is tall, reaching a height of 2-4ft. and a width of 3-5ft in ideal conditions. The leaves of this beautiful, exotic looking foliage plant can be as large as 16″-18″ long and 7″-14″  wide. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  Unlike many philodendrons, like the Monstera Deliciosa, the Xanadu is an upright plant not a climber or vine. The best part is the older a Xanadu gets the better it looks.
A Philodendron Xanadu needs more light than other philodendron plants to maintain its compact appearance. It grows best in medium, indirect light. Too much bright light causes the leaves to become pale and bleached looking; too little light and the stems become elongated as the plant stretches towards the light. Direct sun burns the leaves.
Water a Xanadu thoroughly until the water drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot, and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Leaves turn yellow if the soil stays too wet. A Xanadu grows more slowly in the winter and requires less water.
Feed monthly in the spring and fall, every other week in the summer, and never in the winter. Use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the leaves are getting smaller and new growth is slow, the plant needs more food.
Daytime temperatures 75° to 80°F ( 23.9°-26.7°C); nighttime temperatures 65°- 70° F (18.3°-21.1°C)
Philodendrons like high humidity but still grow well in regular household humidity.
A Philodendron Xanadu attracts aphids and mealy bugs. If the air is very dry, spider mites are also a problem.
Bacterial diseases, especially all varieties of leaf spot disease, are a problem for the Philodendron Xanadu. Root rot from over- watering can seriously hurt the plant and cause the plant to die. Cool temperatures, dry leaves, and good air circulation helps prevent diseases.
Use a potting soil high in organic matter that drains quickly.
These plants like to be repotted as soon as their roots start to fill the existing pot. Use a a container that has drip holes in the botton and is about two -three inches larger than the root ball.
A Xanadu does not require much pruning. If the plant is getting too large and taking over your room, remove leaves by cutting them off at the base of their stem.
A Xanadu is propagated by plant division. Read about this type of propagation technique in the Glossary of the website.
A Philodendron Xanadu is a poisonous plant with a level #1 toxicity. Philodendrons are especially poisonous to dogs and cats.
A Philodendron Xanadu never needs to be pruned. The plant’s shape usually resembles a large mushroom cap. Keep a Philodendron Xanadu in good light so that it stays compact and does not become leggy and sparse looking.
Propagate a Philodendron Xanadu by simple plant division. Separate the plant and its roots into two sections, use your hand to gently pull the root ball apart, do not use a knife. Plant the Philodendron Xanadu sections in pots that are only an inch or two larger than the root ball to prevent over-watering and root rot.
There is a new variety called the Golden Philodendron Xanadu. The beautiful leaf shape is the same, but the color of the leaves goes from a glossy bright yellow to various shades of green.
A Philodendron Xanadu may get flowers especially if you put it outside in the shade during the summer. The flowers, however, are not very attractive. I‘d cut them off so the beautiful leaves can grow more quickly."
76,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Kalanchoe Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/kalanchoe-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"At one time, a kalanchoe plant was only sold as a flowering Christmas plant. Today kalanchoe plants are sold in bloom throughout the year and are one of our most popular indoor, flowering houseplants.  A kalanchoe plant, native to Madagascar, is a member of the Crassulaceae family and a close relative of the jade plant. This is an easy-care, succulent plant that grows extremely well in a bright spot in your home. Be sure to keep the temperature above 50° and be careful not to over water. Repot once the plant has finished flowering and has rested for about a month.
The kalanchoe “blossfeldiana” is the most frequently sold variety. This is a short, bushy, upright plant, about 12” to 18” inches tall and  6” to 20” wide , with thick, oval-shaped, scalloped leaves. The long-lasting, star-like blooms on a kalanchoe blossfeldiana appear in clusters at the ends of sturdy stems throughout the year. The vibrant colored flowers come in red, orange, yellow, lavender, white, and pink. Some new varieties even have bi-colored flowers. The kalanchoe “mangginii” has fleshy, rounded leaves, and produces large, bell-shaped flowers in bright red and reddish/orange during the spring. The leaves of both varieties turn red when the plant is in very bright light. Best of all, the blooms on kalanchoe plants may last up to 8 weeks. If you are quick to deadhead the plant (pinch off dead flowers), you’ll encourage the plant to bloom more often and produce a greater number of flowers.
K. Pink Butterflies (K. Mother of Millions) has hundreds of bright pink baby plants along the leaf edges that fall off and root.
K. Calandiva is in a type of  K.blossfeldiana but with larger and more beautiful flowers.
K. Albino has white scalloped leaves trimmed in pink
K. Paddle (flapjack paddle plant) has thick, leathery, paddle-shaped leaves. During the winter the leaves often turn bright red.
K. Panda has velvety, long, oblong leaves with brown decorative spots along the leaf edges.
K. Mangginii (Chandelier plant) has fleshy, rounded leaves, and produces large, bell-shaped flowers in bright red and reddish/orange during the spring.

A kalanchoe is a wonderful indoor plant to perk up your home during the long winter months. The shorter the days and the longer the nights, the more flowers a kalanchoe plant produces. Kalanchoes are also a perfect gift for someone who loves flowering plants but doesn’t have very much time to take care of it. Keep in mind, however, that all varieties of kalanchoe plants contain cardiac glycosides and are poisonous plants and must be kept away from small children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a kalanchoe plant: A kalanchoe plant needs bright, indirect light and can even tolerate direct sun during the fall, winter, and spring. Direct sun in the summer is too intense and burns the leaves. The blooms on a kalanchoe plant are photo-periodically induced. As the days get shorter and a kalanchoe experiences longer periods of darkness, the plant produces more flowers.
How to water a kalanchoe plant: The succulent kalanchoe plant has plump leaves that store water for long periods of time. These plants are easily over-watered which results in root-rot. Always allow the top 50% of the soil to dry-out before watering a kalanchoe. If the soil is exceptionally dry, sit the plant in a deep saucer of water for about ten minutes; this not only prevents over-watering, but keeps the leaves dry. Wet leaves encourage plant diseases such as leaf spot or powdery mildew.
How to fertilize a kalanchoe: Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing with a fertilizer high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the soil is very dry, moisten the soil with plain water before fertilizing; this prevents the plant food from burning the roots.
Best temperature for a kalanchoe plant: Indoor kalanchoe plants like warm temperatures between 60°-85°f (15.6°-18.3°c). Low temperatures below 40°f (4.4°c) can damage or kill a kalanchoe plant within a few hours. Keep these plants away from cold drafts and open windows during the winter.
Humidity for a kalanchoe: Kalanchoes grow well in regular to low household humidity. When the humidity is too high, these plants develop plant diseases such as leaf spot or powdery mildew.
Flowering tips: Removing faded blooms as soon as they appear encourages more flower development. Starting in October, keep a kalanchoe plant in total darkness for up to 14 hours a day. This encourages the plant to bloom even more.
Kalanchoe plant pests: A kalanchoe plant is fairly pest resistant. When placed outdoors for the summer, they may attract mites, scale, and aphids. These plants are very sensitive to chemical insecticides. When treating a kalanchoe for a pest infestation, use the “Green Solution”, yellow sticky cards, insecticidal soap, or Neem oil. You can read about all of these products and how to make the Green Solution in the Glossary of the website.
Kalanchoe plant diseases: A kalanchoe plant may get leaf spot disease and powdery mildew. The best way to prevent these plant diseases is to keep the leaves dry and provide good air circulation around the plant. Read more about how to identify and treat these plant diseases in the glossary of the website.
Best soil for a kalanchoe plant: Use a light soil composed of peat moss, sand, and perlite that drains well for a kalanchoe. When using a basic, store-bought potting soil, be sure to add an equal amount of sand for good drainage.
Pot size for a kalanchoe plant: Kalanchoe plants are sold in 4″ and 6″ pots. They rarely need to be in a container larger than 8” wide and 6” deep. Kalanchoe containers must have drip holes in the bottom so excess water can drain out. If the pot is too large and the soil stays wet too long, the roots die.
How to prune a kalanchoe plant: Remove dead or dying flowers as soon as they appear. Cut bare bare stems to keep the plant full and bushy.
How to propagate avalanche plant: Stem cuttings, plant division, and offsets are the best way to propagate a kalanchoe plant.When using stem tip cuttings, be sure to allow the cut end of the stems to dry out for 24 hours before planting them; this prevents the cuttings from developing root rot.
Kalanchoes need a month or two of rest starting at the end of September. Place your plant in a cool (around 65°f /18.3°c), low-light spot and keep the soil dryer that usual. After six weeks, return the plant to a warm, bright location and resume normal watering. This technique helps a kalanchoe produce more flowers.
Kalanchoes make great presents since, unlike cut flowers, they bloom for years.
A Kalanchoe is a poisonous plant and is toxic to cats and dogs. They belong to a group of plants that contain naturally-occurring poisons that affect the heart. The toxins in kalanchoe plants are similar to digitalis or digoxin, a common heart medication used in both human and veterinary medicine. The severity of the injury depends upon the amount of plant eaten. All parts of the plant are considered toxic, even the water in the vase of cut kalanchoe flowers is dangerous.
Kalanchoes do very well outside as long as you keep them out of the direct sun and out of the rain. Be sure to bring them indoors before the weather starts to get cold and check for bugs!
It sounds like your kalanchoe may have a fungal infection. Fungal infections are usually caused by water dripping on the leaves or very high humidity. Remove the diseased leaves, keep water off the leaves, increase the air circulation around the plant, and move your kalanchoe to a less humid location.
The best way to prune a kalanchoe is to cut the stems back to aabout 4″ above the soil line. After you prune the plant, place it in bright indirect light. It should become full and bushy in a short time.
Absolutely not! Do not throw out your kalanchoe once the flowers die. With proper care, kalanchoes bloom on and off all year for many years."
77,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Maidenhair Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/maidenhair-fern-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Maiden Hair fern, which originated in the Brazilian tropics, can be found growing in temperate climates throughout the world. The graceful, delicate fronds sometimes reach 20″-24″ in length and are covered in tiny, triangular, bright green leaflets called pinnae. During the spring, a Maidenhair Fern produces fronds that seem to have tiny dark brown “spots” on the underside of the leaf edges. The “spots” are really fern spores; this is how the fern propagates in nature. These specialized fronds do not live as long as regular fronds and if you don’t like the way they look just cut them off.  Although a Maidenhair fern does require more care and attention, with the proper care this plant can live for a long while, growing more beautiful with each passing year.
A maidenhair fern prefers bright indirect light but still grows slowly in medium light. It can handle early morning sun, but afternoon sun burns the fronds.
Keep the soil moist but not soggy and never allow it to totally dry out. If the soil is too wet, a maidenhair fern develops root rot and fungal diseases.
Feed every 2 weeks during the late fall and early spring (Sept-March) with a liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. These plants love fish emulsions a plant food.
Maidenhair ferns need consistent temperatures. They can handle warmth or cold, but prefer warm areas. Never place a maidenhair fern where the temperature fluctuates constantly.
As with temperature, consistent humidity is very important. Maidenhair ferns prefer high humidity but do not like to be misted. Placing them on a pebble tray filled with water is the best solution. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Dry air causes the leaflets on the fronds to shrivel.
Aphids, mealy bugs, and scale are attracted to these ferns. Rinse the entire plant in soapy water to treat a pest infestation.
Because maidenhair ferns like high humidity, gray mold can be a problem.
Use a very rich, quick-draining soil.
These plants like to be in a small pot. Don’t move a maidenhair fern to a larger pot until its roots have filled the existing pot.
Quickly remove any dead or dying fronds; they drain the plant’s energy and slow down growth.
In nature, maidenhair ferns are propagated by the tiny spores released from the underside of their leaves. Indoors, try plant division in the spring to start new ferns.
A maidenhair fern is a non-poisonous plant.
Maidenhair ferns need consistency and they don’t get it in the bathroom. After a shower the room is warm and humid, but the rest of the day and night it’s colder and the air is much drier. Find a spot where the temperature and humidity don’t fluctuate.
The tiny brown things are reproductive spores and are perfectly normal. The spores only appear on certain fronds so if you don’t like the way they look, cut off those fronds.
These ferns just don’t like being moved even if it’s from one good location to another. It will take a while for it to acclimate to its new home, so be patient, sooner or later it will start growing again."
78,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Orchid – Phalaenopsis Orchid Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/orchid-phalaenopsis-orchid-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Orchid plants are one of the largest plant species in the world with over 100,000 different varieties, but only small percentage are suitable for growing indoors. A phalaenopsis orchid plant, also known as the Moth Orchid, is one of the varieties that does quite well. There are about 45 species in the Phalaenopsis genus and most are native to India, southern China, and Southeast Asia. A phalaenopsis orchid is a type of epiphytic plant which means, in nature, it grows on the trunks and branches of trees. As a houseplant, and with proper care, a phalaenopsis orchid plant blooms again and again for many years. It has become very popular because unlike other orchid plants, it has no resting period and may flower several times throughout the year.
In nature a phalaenopsis orchid plant sends out aerial roots so it can cling to trees, so as a houseplant most of its roots are above the pot and grow outside the container. This is perfectly normal so don’t cut them off.  Tall flower stalks grow out of the leaf joints and produce 3″-6″ wide, flattened flowers. The exquisite flowers grow in a line on long arching stems and can be yellow, white, pink, lavender, purple, cream, spotted, or striped.  They often last 2-3 months. The large, leathery, green, succulent leaves, as much as 18” long, are elliptic in shape and grow directly from the roots.
Phalaenopsis Orchid plants are a beautiful, inexpensive replacement for a cut flower arrangement or just an added delight for any room in your home or office. Now that they are being mass produced in greenhouses throughout the world, they are fairly inexpensive and easily available.
There is an orchid plant for almost any lighting condition, but none like being in the direct sun. If an area is too dark, the leaves turn dark green instead of the grassy yellow green they should be and the orchid plant doesn’t bloom. If there is too much light, the leaves turn yellow and develop sunspots. A location near an east or west-facing window is usually the best location. Most orchid plants prefer about 10 hours of light a day.
The easiest way to kill any Orchid Plant is by over-watering. Always allow the top 50% of the potting compost to dry out before watering. Check the roots of an Orchid Plant monthly to be sure they are staying whitish green and plump. Set the plant in a deep saucer of water for about 30 minutes so it can absorb water through the drip holes in the bottom on the pot. Use tepid water that has not passed through a softener (too salty). If your household water has a lot of chemicals in it, allow the water to sit out over night before using it. Type of soil, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence an orchid plant’s watering needs. Orchids dry out a little faster in the winter because of the heat in your home and low humidity.
Fertilize weakly, weekly when an orchid plant is actively growing. Dilute your plant food to 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength. Do not feed an orchid plant when it is dormant or when the plant is in bloom. There are excellent orchid plant foods on the market. You can also use a well- balanced houseplant food at 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength.
Orchid plants do well when the temperature is 65°-80°F (18°-26° C) during the day and 15° cooler at night. In the fall, cool night temperatures help the flower spikes develop. Once the orchid buds appear try to keep the temperature constant or the buds may fall off.
High humidity, 50% or better, is essential. Setting an orchid plant in a stand and placing the stand in a tray filled with pebbles and water helps increase the humidity. Be sure the plant never sits directly in the water.
Orchid plants usually flower from December-May and the flowers can last several months. The spectacular blooms can be as small as 1″ or as large as 5″ depending upon the orchid variety. Try not to get water on the flowers.
Aphids, scale, mealy bugs, and spider mites can be a problem. Good air circulation and near a small fan. The slight breeze also encourages flowers to develop faster. The best ways to treat any insects or pests is to dab them off with a Qtip dipped in alcohol or wipe them off with a soft cloth dipped in soapy water.
Orchid plants are prone to viruses, bacterial infections, and fungal infections. Increasing the air circulation around an is very beneficial in preventing diseases.
Orchid plants require a special soil and should never be planted in regular potting soil, it is much too dense. Use a bark-based or peat based soil that retains water, drains well, and allows the roots to “breathe.” Orchid plant soil should contain bark, sphagnum moss, and perlite. There are several commercial soils that are specifically for orchids.
Re-pot only if the potting medium has decomposed and is not draining quickly enough or if the orchid plant pseudobulbs have outgrown the pot. Remove the orchid from its old pot, shake off the soil around the pseudobulbs, place the plant in its new pot, and then fill in with the new potting mixture.
In nature, orchids get much of their food and water from the air, so never cut off any air roots that emerge from the soil. When the flower stalk turns yellow or brown, it’s time to prune. Cut the stalk back to about an inch from where it originated on the main stem. Use a clean razor blade or very sharp knife when pruning. Always remove any dead or diseased sections immediately, otherwise these sick areas of the plant attract more pests and diseases. Another pruning method for is to wait until your plant has finished blooming, look for tiny bumps or nodes on the flower spike. Find the third node from the bottom and cut the spike off 1″ above that node. Pruning an orchid plant helps the plant produce more flowers during the next season.
Orchid plants are propagated by plant division if they are sympodial, such as a Cattleya Orchid, or by stem cuttings if they are monopodeal, such as a phalaenopsis orchid. Read marabout propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Allvarietiesof orchid plants are non poisonous and safe to have around cat, dogs, and other pets.
Cut your Orchid Plant stem about an inch from where the flower stem originated on the main stem. Another pruning method is after the Orchid Plant has finished blooming, look for tiny bumps or nodes on the flower spike. Find the third from the bottom and cut the spike off 1″ above this node.
Leaves on an Orchid Plant usually become wrinkled when the plant is very dry and needs water. Alternatively, or you may have over-watered your Orchid Plant causing the roots to die, and now the plant can no longer absorb water. If the pseudo-bulbs of your Orchid Plant that are above the soil are shriveled, give the plant more water. You can also carefully take the Orchid Plant out of its pot and check the soil to be sure it’s not soggy at the very bottom. Orchid Plants do not like wet feet! Orchid Plant roots are healthy if they are greenish white and plump.
One of the main reasons an Orchid Plant doesn’t bloom is insufficient light. Start by moving your Orchid Plant to a brighter location. The leaves of an Orchid Plant should be a light to medium green color. Dark green leaves means an Orchid Plant needs more light. Orchid Plants also need a resting period for a month or so in a low light. cool area. While your Orchid Plant is resting, allow the soil to practically dry out before watering. This resting period helps an Orchid Plant go through the proper growth cycle. After about a month or two, move the Orchid Plant back to its previous spot in your home. Be sure to fertilize an Orchid Plant once it starts producing new leaves.
There are several things that cause bud drop on Orchid Houseplants. The first thing is check the moisture in the soil to see if you may be giving your Orchid Plant too much or too little water. The temperature of the location where the Orchid plant sits may be too hot or too cold. Try to keep the temperature above 55 degrees but below 80 degrees. Avoid placing an Orchid Plant near air conditioners and heaters and try not to move an Orchid Plant too often.
The amount of time an Orchid Plant blooms depends upon the species of orchid plant. A Phaleonopsis Orchid can bloom for 1-4 months while a Cattleya Orchid blooms for 1-4 weeks."
79,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/8,Yucca Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/yucca-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The spineless Yucca plant, a native of Guatemala and southeast Mexico, is an ideal, easy care houseplant. Yucca plants can be a bush or a stalk plant.  The long, leathery, sharply pointed leaves of a Yucca plant are a foot or more in length and about an inch wide.  Yucca plants are very top heavy and should always be set into a heavy clay or ceramic pot to prevent them from toppling over. A Yucca plant is poisonous and should be kept away from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. A Yucca is the type of plant that complements a Southwestern look in your home or office.
Yucca plants grow best in bright indirect light. A Yucca can survive indoors in lower light but will need very little water. The slow growing yucca will be even slower to produce new leaves in low to medium light. An ideal location is near a west, east, or south-facing window.
A Yucca plant originates in the deserts of Mexico and Guatemala so it likes to be kept dry. Allow at least the top 50% of the soil of a to dry out before watering. Over watering is the main and probably the only way to kill a yucca.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a basic houseplant food at 1/2 the recommended strength.
A yucca can adapt to temperatures as low as 35° and as high as 90°.
Yucca plants do well in basic and even low household humidity.
Usual household plant pests stay away from a Yucca; even spider mites avoid this plant. If you do notice mealy bugs or scale, spray with the “Green Solution” (recipe in Glossary).
Use a good quality, well-aerated, loose houseplant soil that drains quickly for a Yucca Plant. Add sand to the soil if it seems too heavy or clay-like.
Yucca plants like to be root-bound in small pots.
If a yucca plant becomes top heavy and keeps falling over, cut the trunks off 1/2 way down. New growth will appear on the old trunk making it bushier and less apt to topple. Start new yucca plants using the sections of trunk that you cut off.
A yucca plant is propagated by stem (trunk) cuttings and offsets.
Yucca plants are slightly poisonous with a #1 toxicity level. The poisonous part of the plant is difficult to reach, but a persistent child or pet might be able to get through the tough exterior and eat it.
When the bottom leaves on a yucca turn light brown and crispy, it usually means the plant needs more water. Be careful not to over do it, but water your yucca a little more frequently.
My suggestion to help your yucca look better is to cut the main stalk off just above the new growth at the bottom. This will encourage lots of new shoots on the cane. Plant the green top section that you cut off, include about 12″ of the stalk, in the bottom of the existing pot. This Yucca cutting should root in about four weeks and you’ll have a great looking plant.
The stems, or stalks, of yucca houseplants get soft and mushy when they are overwatered. Take your yucca out of the pot, get rid of all the wet soil, and allow it to lay out bare root for a day or two. Remove all of the stalk above the mushy part of the stem. Repot in dry succulent soil. The pot should barely fit the roots of the plant. If the roots aren’t totally destroyed, your plant should start sending out new shoots in about a month."
80,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Orchid – Cymbidium Orchid Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/cymbidium-orchid-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Cymbidium Orchid plant, or Boat orchid, is among the most attractive, popular, and long lasting orchid plants available throughout the world.  The name Cymbidium comes from the greek word Kumbos which means cavity and refers to the shape of the base of the lip of the flower. Cymbidium orchids  have been cultivated for thousands of years in Eastern Asia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Borneo, northern Australia, and the Himalayas but only became popular in Europe during the Victorian Age. Today, because of the many hybrid Cymbidium orchid plants, they grow throughout the world. These plants have long, thin, grass – like leaves. Sturdy stems or spikes emerge from the leaves of the plant and each spike produces 15-30 beautiful waxy- looking orchid flowers. There are over 52 varieties of Cymbidiums, each with a different color and pattern to their flowers. Cymbidium blooms, which often last for months, come in yellow, red, pink, orange, light green, yellowish green, white, cream, and even brown. The only flower colors missing are blue and black. These plants have the added advantage of being able to bloom during the winter when other orchids cannot. Although Cymbidium orchid plants require a little extra care (as do Phaleonopsis Orchid plants) and prefer a special soil, their beautiful flowers make it all worthwhile.
Cymbidium orchids like as much bright, indirect light as you can provide; but avoid placing them in the direct sun. Light green upright leaves indicate that your orchid plant is getting the proper amount of light. Dark green leaves mean a Cymbidium orchid needs more light. Yellow leaves are an indication that they are getting too much light.
The easiest way to kill Cymbidium orchid plants is by over-watering. When watering, thoroughly drench the plant, then let the excess water drain out the bottom drip holes. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. You can prevent over and under-watering by checking the roots, they should be whitish- green and plump. Follow these few watering tips to prevent watering problems. Never allow orchid plants sit in water. Do not get water on the leaves or flowers. Never use water that has passed through a softener. Soil type, temperature, time of year, humidity, and pot size all influence how much water orchid plants need. The soil dries out faster in winter because of the heat and low humidity in homes and offices. Too much or too little water is the main cause of Bud Blast, orchid buds dying before they open.
Fertilize weakly, weekly when an orchid plant is actively growing. Dilute your plant food to 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength. Do not feed an orchid plant when it is dormant or when the plant is in bloom. There are excellent orchid plant foods on the market. You can also use a well- balanced houseplant food at 1/3-1/4 the recommended strength.
Temperature is another important factor if you want indoor Cymbidium orchids to bloom. Ideal temperatures for the flower buds to set is 65°F-70°F (18.3°C-21.1°C) during the day and 10°-15° cooler at night. Temperature is especially important during the fall when orchid flowers are just starting to develop. Cymbidium plants can handle temperatures as low as 45°F (7° C), but do not do well in temperatures above 80° F (26.7°C). The higher the temperature, the more important it is to have good air movement around the plant.
High humidity is a necessity. If your home or office does not have at least 50% humidity, place your orchid plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure it is sitting on the pebbles and never in the water. Do not mist an orchid plant; it can cause fungal and bacterial plant diseases.
One of the nicest things about Cymbidium orchids is that they bloom in the winter when other indoor plant do not. The flower spikes on Cymbidium orchids set during the fall and winter when temperature are about 50°F (10°C) at night. Once the flower spikes appear, don’t move your Cymbidium orchid or keep the room too warm until the buds open. Blooms last longer when temperatures stay between 60°-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C). Be sure to stake the flower spikes so the blooms are above the leaves of the plant. Do not fertilize orchid plants while they are in bloom.
Mealy bugs can be removed using a Qtip dipped in alcohol. Wipe orchid plants with a soft cloth dipped in soapy water to remove spider mites, aphids, or scale. You can also use neem oil or insecticidal soap.
Cymbidium orchid diseases are caused by a fungus or virus. These plant diseases can quickly spread to others plants if you’re not careful. Viruses appear as pale streaks in the leaves. As the problem worsens, the leaves become pitted and bleached-out looking. Fungal infections cause yellow, brown, and then black leaves. Roots develop black spotted areas and the orchid cannot absorb water. Fungal infections on indoor orchid plant are the result of over- watering, poor air circulation, and wet foliage. Keep infected plants away from other plants or throw them out. Sterilize your scissors, knives, or other tools with alcohol before going from plant to plant. Treat fungal diseases with fungicides sold at local garden stores. Another way to treat Cymbidium orchid diseases is by using the Bordeaux Solution, a mixture of water, hydrated lime, and copper sulfate.
Cymbidium orchid plants need a special orchid soil or potting medium. Never use regular houseplant soil. Proper orchid planting medium contains peat moss, bark compost, and osmunda fiber. The right plant soil be found at any garden center.
Many of the new hybrid Cymbidium orchid plants are small enough to grow in 5”- 6” pots that can fit on a windowsill. Orchid plants like to be root-bound so don’t rush to move them to a larger container. Use clay or plastic pots for orchids. Be sure any pot you use has drainage holes. When re-potting a Cymbidium orchid shake off the excess soil and throw away any pseudobulbs that are shriveled and dried up.
Once the flowers die, find the nodes on the flower spike. Cut the spike off 1″ above the 3rd node from the bottom. Immediately remove dead or diseased parts on the plant or they will attract pests and diseases.
Propagate Cymbidium orchid plants in the spring when the plant has finished blooming. As orchid plants mature, they produce pseudobulbs. Pseudobulbs store water and nutrients and new plant leaves emerge from them. Cymbidium orchid plants should be divided every three or four years. To propagate these orchids, gently split the pseudo bulbs apart. Each section should have at least three healthy pseudobulbs. Center the orchid bulbs in the new container with the lower 1/3 of the bulb below the soil. The container should be only an inch or two larger than the pseudo bulb cluster.
Cymbidium orchid plants need a resting period if you want them to flower. Once a year move indoor orchid plants to a cool, dark area for a month and reduce how much water you give the plant. After the plant has rested, return it to its usual bright location.
Orchid plants are beautiful gifts for any occasion.
Cymbidium orchid plants are non-poisonous.
The best way to get an orchid plant to bloom is to make sure the plant is getting the right amount of water and light. Are the leaves a bright medium green, not dark green and not yellow green? This shows the orchid plant is getting enough bright light. Are the roots firm and whitish green, indicating that the plant is being watered properly? Is there good air circulation? Is the temperature between 65°-75F°(18.3-21.1°C) during the day and 15° cooler at night? If you think you’re caring for your orchid plant correctly, you may just have to be patient. It might be the wrong time of the year for it to bloom or your type of orchid plant may have to mature before it can produce more blooms.
The spots on the leaves of your indoor orchid plant could be a number of things. If you can scrape the bumps off, then it is probably a plant disease called scale. If the spots are surrounded by a yellow halo, it is a sign of a plant fungal infection. Another sign of a plant fungal infection is yellow spots with black edges. Because orchid plants require high humidity, they are prone to fungal and viral diseases. If infected with a plant disease, treat your plant with a commercial Fungicide or the Bordeaux Mixture (a combination of water, hydrated lime, and copper sulfate). Provide good air circulation around all orchid plants to prevent infections.
There are several reasons why leaves turn yellow on an orchid plant, the most common is that the leaves are old and are naturally dying. Some other causes of yellow leaves on orchid plants are: the plant needs more nitrogen; the temperature is too cold; the orchid is getting too much bright light; the roots have died from over- watering.
Brown and black streaks on the leaves of an orchid plant usually indicate a virus infection. I’d recommend immediately isolating the sick plant from your other plants before the virus spreads. Identifying which disease is affecting your plant is important so you can determine the proper treatment. If it is a fungal disease, it can be treated with any plant Fungicide sold at a local garden store; but viral diseases are very difficult to treat. Cut off all of the diseased areas and hope for the best."
81,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Prayer Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/prayer-plant/,,,"The prayer plant (Maranta leuconeura) is a very special plant. Every evening, when it gets dark, the leaves of a prayer plant fold up as though praying. There is a small joint between the stems and the leaves that allows this to occur. In the morning, as the plant reache for the light, the leaves unfurl and open again. Because of the name, a prayer plant is often sent as a gift to funerals. Prayer plants are part of the Maranta plant group which includes four closely related plants, the calathea, ctenanthe, stromanthe and the prayer plant. All varieties of Marantas are part of the larger Marantaceae family and are native to tropical Central and South America and the West Indies. Today, the prayer plant is primarily grown as an indoor plant.
The large leaves of a prayer plant have colorful veins and bright patterns in red, green, brown, and cream. The flowers, however, are small and insignificant. The patches of color in the leaves get darker and more vibrant as the plant matures. A prayer plant is a short, spreading plant that is usually about 8″ to 12″  (20-25cm) tall and 12″ to 20″ (30-50cm) wide. The broad, oval, paddle shaped leaves are 5″ to 7″  (13-18cm) long.
Herringbone or Red Prayer Plant (Maranta erthrophylla leuconeura)  has bold red veins.
Black Prayer Plant ( Maranta leuconeura var. “Massangeana”) has blackish, green leaves with silvery veins.
Green Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura “Kerchoveana”) is also called a Rabbit’s Tracks prayer plant because its green leaves have two rows of small, brown patches.
Dry air and low humidity cause stunted growth and brown leaf tips
Leaves curl and bottom leaves turn yellow when plant does not get enough water
Leaves burn and get ugly brown marks when the plant is in the direct sun
Leaf drop is caused by low humidity
Stems become limp and start to die when it is too cold or the soil is too wet
Provide high humidity
Keep winter temperature above 55°F
Keep soil barely moist at all times and water less in winter
Propagate by plant division when you repot in the spring every few years
This lovely plant with beautiful leaves is not difficult to grow if you provide the specific care it requires. Lack of humidity due to the dry air in our homes is the main cause of most  prayer plant problems. A prayer plant is a non-poisonous plant safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
How much light does a prayer plant need: Provide medium to high light, but avoid putting a prayer plant in the direct sun. When there is not enough light, the leaves close at night and do not fully open during the day. When there is too much light or direct sun, the color in the leaves fade.
How much water for a prayer plant: Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy at all times. Unlike most houseplants, a prayer plant does not like to have the soil dry out before you water. Water less in the winter when the plant is resting.
How to feed a prayer plant: This is is acid loving houseplant, fertilize with a food like Miracid diluted to ½ the recommended strength every two weeks in the spring and summer. It’s not necessary to feed a prayer plant in the winter and fall; it will also benefit from your extra tea. A prayer plant develops yellow leaves when it’s getting enough iron. You can fix the problem by using a cheated iron product available where fertilizers are sold.
Best temperature for a prayer plant: Provide warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C). Low temperatures and cold drafts damage the leaves.
Does a prayer plant need high humidity: High humidity is essential! When the air is too dry, a prayer plant may lose leaves, get brown leaf tips, or have stunted growth. The humidity in ours homes is often too low. Increase the humidity by grouping plants together, putting a small humidifier or bowl of water near the plant, or setting a prayer plant on a tray filled with water and small pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Does a prayer plant flower: The flowers are small and insignificant. It is the leaves that are the beautiful part of a prayer plant.
Prayer plant pests: Spider mites and aphids ca be a problem. learn how to recognize and treat these plant pests in the Glossary the website.
Prayer plant diseases: The high humidity a prayer plant needs encourages Leaf Spot disease and other fungal diseases. Providing good air circulation and keeping the leaves dry helps prevent diseases. Read more about Leaf Spot disease and how to identify and treat it in the Glossary of the website.
Best soil for a prayer plant: Use a well-aerated, peat based, indoor potting soil that retains water yet still drains quickly.
Proper pot for a prayer plant: Since this plant has very short roots, use a shallow pot that has drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a prayer plant: Trim the stems twice a year to keep the plant compact and bushy.
How to propagate a prayer plant: Plant division and stem cuttings are the best propagation methods. Read more about how to propagate plants in the Glossary of the website.
A prayer plant is a popular gift for funerals. The leaves close at night and unfold the next morning, as though the plant were praying.
A prayer plant is a non-poisonous houseplant and is safe to have around cats, dogs, and small children.
The main reasons a prayer plant gets brown leaf edges are dry air and low humidity.
A prayer plant doesn’t develop leaves as quickly when it’s producing flowers. Personally, I like the leaves more than the flowers, so I always cut the flowers off.
The leaves of a prayer plant usually fade because it is getting too much light. Move your plant to a shadier location and see if that solves the problem. Check the leaves carefully to be sure there is no spider mite infestation.
A prayer plant is an acid-loving houseplant, tea is acidic, so it’s definitely a good idea. Just don’t drown your plant in too much tea!!
There are several reasons why the leaves of a prayer plant shrivel up: too much direct sun, heavily chlorinated water, low humidity, and cold air."
82,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Podocarpus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/podocarpus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Podocarpus plant, also called a Buddhist Pine or Japanese Yew, is a very dense, upright, slow growing evergreen that originally came from China and Japan. It has long slender dark green leathery leaves. A Podocarpus plant grows straight up with very little side branching unless it is actively pruned. This plant is relatively simple to care for and adapts well to various conditions. It is easily trained to be a bonsai or a topiary. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. When planted outside in the ground a Podocarpus plant grows quite large, but when used indoors or on the porch as a potted plant, it remains a small tree or shrub.
A Podocarpus requires very bright indirect light. If it is not getting enough light the lower needles on the branches become large and elongated.
Keep the soil moist but not soggy; allow the top two inches to dry out before watering. Brown leaf tips or gray needles indicate over- watering.
Feed a Podocarpus every two weeks in the spring and summer when it is actively growing. Use a plant food that is designed for acid loving plants such as Miracid at 1/2 the recommended strength.
Podocarpus prefer cool temperatures between 50°-75°F (10°-23.9°C).
These plants do best in medium humidity. If your home is very dry, especially in the winter, set a small humidifier near your Podocarpus or place it on a bed of wet gravel. Be sure the plant is sitting on the gravel and not in the water.
The flowers of this plant are very small and inconspicuous.
Podocarpus are susceptible to Mealy Bugs and Scale.
Although the soil should be kept somewhat moist, over watering leads to root rot. Sooty Mold is another disease that can infect a Podocarpus.
Use a well-aerated acidic soil. Add perlite or sand if your soil seems too heavy or clay-like.
A Podocarpus must be actively and aggressively pruned to maintain any kind of shape. Pruning back the new growth on the vertical stem encourages side branches and a fuller bushier plant.
Propagate a Podocarpus using soft wood stem cuttings in the early spring.
A Podocarpus has a level #1 toxicity if eaten. However, various parts of the plant, especially the seeds within the berries are very harmful to dogs, cats, and horses. This plant should be kept away from small children and animals.
First stake the main vertical stem of your Podocarpus; next prune back the new growth on the vertical stem. Cutting off the new growth encourages side branches. Your Podocarpus will become sturdier and bushier in no time.
The main reason a Podocarpus gets brown tips is from over-watering. Cold drafts and very dry air can also cause brown tips.
The Black Dust is called sooty mold. sooty molds are a form of fungi that grow on the sugary honeydew secreted by Aphids, scales, the whitefly, and other insects that suck the sap from plants. sooty mold is an unsightly black powder that can quickly coat the leaves of a plant in just a few weeks. The fungus itself doesn’t really harm the plant; it just ruins the plant’s appearance. What you need to do is get rid of the insects that are secreting the honeydew that is attracting the sooty mold."
83,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Calla Lily Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/calla-lily-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Calla Lily plant, Zantedeschia aethiopica, produces beautiful flowers when grown outdoors, planted in the ground in a warm area, or indoors grown in a decorative pot next to a sunny window. This elegant plant, native to the marshes of South Africa, is not a true lily or even in the Lilium family. A Calla Lily is a member of the Araceae family and a relative of the caladium plant. The long-lasting flowers are popular in wedding bouquets where they are a symbol of purity and beauty.
A Calla Lily plant is grown from small rhizomes. A rhizome is a long, thick, modified stem that grows horizontally underground. It produces shoots that grow upwards and out of the soil and roots that grow downwards. Rhizomes, like plant bulbs, not only support the plant but store food and other nutrients. The large, tubular or funnel shaped Calla Lily flowers (spathes), grow atop tall, thick stems and have a finger-like yellow spadix in the center. The flower can be as large as 10″ (25.4cm) long. The long tapered green leaves of the plant may be streaked with faint white or yellow spots.  Today, thanks to the many new hybrids developed by breeders throughout the world, Calla Lilies can be found not only in white, but also pink, orange, fuchsia, red, yellow, dark maroon, and cream.
Needs bright, indirect light but no direct sun
Keep soil moist but never soggy at all times
Feed every 2 weeks when flowering and monthly when there are only leaves.
Cool temperatures 50°-75°F (10°-24°C)Keep in small pot to encourage more flowers
Plant must have a 2-3 month dormant (rest) period if you want it to flower
Propagate by dividing the rhizomes
Zantedeschia aethiopica – “White Calla Lily” – white flowers
Zantedeschia elliottiana – “Golden Calla Lily”  bright yellow flowers
Zantedeschia  “Picasso” – dark purple flowers with a creamy white border
Zantedeschia “Mango” –  peach colored flowers with a dark brown center and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia  “Captain Amigo” –  golden yellow flowers that blend into deep orange and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia  “Mozart “ –  peachy pink flowers and green leaves with white spots
Zantedeschia “Black Star” –  dark purple almost black flowers and green leaves with white spots.
Zantedeschia “Captain  Romance”  deep pink and cream colored flowers and green leaves with white spots
A Calla Lily is a beautiful plant that produces elegant looking flowers. It is well worth the extra time and effort it takes to follow the care tips below, especially when its time for the plant to have a rest and go dormant for a few months. A Calla Lily is a poisonous plant and should be kept way from small children and pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Calla Lilies require at least six hours a day of very bright indirect light. Avoid direct sun, especially during the middle of the day, since it will burn the leaves and flowers.
These plants like moist soil at all times. Calla Lilies are not drought resistant and should never be allowed to totally dry out. Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Never allow a Calla Lily to sit in water for more than 15 minutes.
Fertilize an indoor Calla Lily every two weeks when the plant is flowering with a liquid plant food low in nitrogen. When the plant is producing only leaves and no flowers, fertilize monthly. Always dilute the plant food to ½ the recommended strength. If your Calla Lily is planted outside, use a granular plant food instead of a liquid fertilizer.
Room temperatures should be between 50°-75°F (10°-24°C) for optimal growth. Keep Calla Lilies away from heating and air conditioning vents. If planted outdoors, be sure to dig up the Calla Lily bulbs and bring them inside before temperatures dip below freezing.
Calla Lilies do well in average humidity.
The flowers of a Calla Lily are really spaths similar to those of a Peace Lily but much more impressive. The plant usually blooms for about six weeks during the late spring and early summer. Keeping the plant root- bound encourages more flowers. Calla Lilies may be forced to bloom at any time indoors. The long lasting cut flowers are perfect in bouquets and flower arrangements.
Examine a Calla Lily frequently for signs of scale or aphids.
Calla Lilies are susceptible to various viruses and bacterial infections, especially rhizome rot and gray mold. These problems become evident when leaves and stems start to turn yellow before the plant is normally entering its dormant phase.
Use a good peat moss based potting soil that is well aerated and drains quickly. You can add builder’s sand or perlite if the soil seems too heavy and clay-like.
Bulbs can be removed from their pots and stored in a cool dark location during their yearly dormant period. After 2-3 months of rest, plant the Calla Lily rhizomes (bulbs) in a clean pot with fresh rich soil. Use deep pots for Calla Lily bulbs, planting one bulb in a five-or six-inch pot, or two or three bulbs in an eight-inch pot. Plant the Calla Lily rhizomes (bulbs) deep enough so that they are covered by at least twice the height of the bulb. Calla Lilies usually bloom about 60 days after the bulbs are planted.
Calla Lilies only need to be pruned when they are entering their dormant or resting phase.
Callas Lilies can be propagated by division and seeds. The easiest method is to simply divide the rhizomes in the early spring and plant a single rhizome (bulb) in a deep six inch pot. Wait until the plant has started to produce new green leaves before going back to a regular fertilization program.
Calla Lily, a bulb plant, becomes dormant once a year. After the plant has finished blooming, the leaves turn yellow and then brown. Once this occurs prune the plant down to the soil level and put it in a cool dark area where the temperature is above freezing but no higher than 50°F (10°C) for 2-3 months. Keep the soil very dry, watering sparingly every few weeks to prevent the bulbs from drying out. The area where the plant is stored should be low in humidity otherwise the bulbs get moldy and rot. After two or three months, return your Calla Lily to a bright warm spot and start watering. Once green leaves develop, feed with a fertilizer specifically for bulbs at ½ the recommended strength to encourage the new growth. The plant should start to bloom again in 6-8 weeks.
Calla Lilies are lovely gifts for any occasion.
A Calla Lily is a very poisonous houseplant with a #3 toxicity level. Please keep it away from small children and pets. This plant contains high levels of calcium oxalate and ingestion may cause severe burning and swelling of the mouth, throat, lips, and tongue. Stomach distress and diarrhea can also occur.
After your Calla Lilies finish blooming you’ll see a seed pod hanging just behind where the flower was. Let the seed pod remain on the plant until it turns yellow and becomes soft. Once you remove the pod, gently break it open and remove the seeds from the inner pulp. If you want to grow Calla Lilies from seed you have to be very patient. Calla Lilies usually take 3 or more years to produce flowers after the seeds are planted.
Calla Lilies take about 12-14 weeks for the flowers to look their best. So I’d recommend planting the bulbs about 3 1/2 months before you plan to use the flowers. Be sure to have a back up flower plan in case the Calla Lilies have a problem and don’t produce the number of blooms you’re hoping for in time for your wedding.
There are several reasons why a Calla Lily produces only leaves and no flowers.
Just the opposite, you should never feed a Calla Lily when it is in bloom. Good quality Calla Lily bulbs do not need much fertilizer so always err on the side of less food rather than more."
84,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Pothos Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/pothos-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An “Epipremnum aureum“, or a Pothos plant as we know it, was originally found in the jungles of Malaysia, China, Australia, and islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Since the light at the floor of a dense, tropical jungle is often not very bright, pothos plants used the aerial roots on their long vines to cling to the trunks of trees and grow upwards towards the sunlight. Pothos plants are sometimes referred to as “Devil’s Ivy” because it is a very forgiving plant that quickly recovers and starts growing again even after suffering from poor care and poor growing conditions.
A pothos plant is a highly adaptable, glossy-leafed plant with leathery, pointed, heart-shaped leaves. When growing outdoors, the leaves of a pothos plant can be as large as 10”-12” (25cm-30cm). Indoors, the leaves are much smaller, usually ranging in size from 4”-6” (10cm-15cm). The solid green pothos is often confused with a heart-leaf philodendron. A pothos plant produces long, vines and looks wonderful in a hanging basket. You can also attach the stems to a moss or styrofoam pole and have a tall, upright plant.
The leaves of this hardy plant come in several colors and leaf patterns.
Golden Pothos plant has yellow and green leaves.
Marble Queen Pothos has white and green leaves.
Jade Pothos has solid green leaves.
Neon Pothos has bright green neon-colored leaves
n’joy Pothos has green leaves with a cream and yellow variegation.
Satin Pothos has dark green leaves with silver markings
    
Satin Pothos              Neon Pothos                       n’Joy Pothos              Marble Queen Pothos
Minimum temperature 55°F (12.8°C)
Select the right variety for the lighting in your home
Easily propagated from stem cutting in the spring
Allow the tip 50% of the soil to dry out before watering
Pothos are easy to care for and a perfect plant for people just starting to grow indoor houseplants (as long they are careful not to over water). Best of all, there is a pothos plant variety for almost any location in your home or business. These plants are  poisonous and are toxic to dogs, cats, and children. Please keep the long vines out of reach. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplant.
How much light for a pothos plant: A Green Jade pothos with solid green leaves does well in low light. A Golden Pothos with yellow and green patterned leaves likes medium light. The Marble Queen pothos with green and white variegated leaves grows best in medium to bright indirect light. The lighter the colors in the leaves of a pothos plant, the more light the plant requires.
How to water a Pothos plant: Water well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Over-watering is the main reason a pothos plant dies. Bright yellow leaves indicate that the soil has dried out a bit too much before you watered it. Leaves turn pale yellow and get black marks when a pothos plant is over- watered. Over watering a pothos plant also causes new growth to turn black.
How to fertilize a Pothos plant: Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing and monthly in the fall and winter. Use a well-balanced plant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a Pothos plant: grows well in temperatures between 55°F – 80°F (12.8°C – 26.7°C). If temperatures drop below 45°F (7.2°C), a pothos plant stops growing and the leaves turn black.
Basic household humidity is all a Pothos plant requires
Pothos plant pests: One of the great things about a Pothos plant is that it is rarely bothered by plant pests. However, if the soil stays too wet and is not allowed to partially dry out, fungus gnats may appear. Mealy bugs are another pest that can sometimes be a problem.
Pothos plant diseases: Over-watering can causes plant diseases such as crown, leaf, and root rot. Once the roots are damaged, it is difficult to save a pothos plant.
Best soil for a Pothos plant: Use a well-aerated, quick-draining potting soil that dries out quickly. This type of soil prevents the roots from staying wet too long and eventually dying.
A Pothos likes to be root-bound in a small pot. Do not rush to move the plant to a larger pot, wait until the roots have filled the existing container. The new pot should be only one size larger than the current pot and have drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a Pothos plant: Aggressively prune the long vines to keep the plant looking bushy and full. 5”- 6” pothos stem cuttings can be rooted in water or vermiculite and used to propagate new plants.
How to propagate a pothos plant: Take stem tip cuttings in the spring and summer. Read complete care instructions on how to propagate a Pothos plant using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
NASA lists a Pothos plant as a “Clean Air Plant” that helps remove harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde from the air.
Pothos plants are poisonous plants with a level #2 toxicity, and is toxic to dogs, cats, and small children.
A pothos plant gets yellow leaves a few days after you water it when you allow the soil to get too dry before watering. Water well, until the water comes out the bottom drip holes. Don’t water again until the top 50% of the soil dries out or the leaves start to droop a little. You can save an under-watered pothos plant, but an over-watered pothos can quickly die.
A pothos plant develops brown, mushy stems and new growth turns black when your pothos plant is over-watered. Cut off the dead stems and don’t water your pothos plant again until the soil has totally dried out; this gives new roots a chance to develop. You can also carefully take the pothos plant out its pot and get rid of the wet soil. Allow the plant to sit out bare root overnight and replant in new, fresh, dry soil.
You need to aggressively prune a pothos plant to help it get it full again. By cutting several inches off of each of the long runners, you’ll encourage new growth to develop all along the stem. You can use the Stem Cuttings to propagate a new pothos plant.
Pothos plant leaves turn black when the air in the room is too cold (below 55° for a long period of time). Cut the damaged leaves off your pothos plant; trim back the stems, and move your plant to a warmer location. The roots are fine and your pothos plant should grow back in no time."
85,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Croton Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/croton-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A croton plant (Codiaeum variegatum pictum) was originally an outdoor, decorative bush growing in tropical regions where temperatures never went below 50°F (1o°C).  Croton plants come in 100 different varieties and have become a very popular houseplant within the last 15-20 years. An indoor croton is an upright plant with beautiful, multicolored, hard, leathery, shiny leaves that come decorated in vivid patterns of red, yellow, green, orange, purple, and black. Leaf shapes can be long, short, narrow, wide, oval, curly, twisted, or oak- leaf. Individual leaves and entire croton plant branches can be used in flower arrangements.
Croton “Petra” is the croton we most frequently see. It has wide, large, oval, vividly patterned leaves in yellow, red, green, orange, and other autumn colors.
Croton “Gold Dust” has smaller, shorter green leaves covered in yellow (gold) specks.
Croton Icetone (Red Iceton): This artistic looking croton variety has glossy, pointed, oval leaves that start out light green and yellow and then become pink and red as the plant matures.
Croton “Mammy” (Mamey): The croton mammy has long, narrow, curling and twisting leaves. The leaves are dark green with splashes of yellow, red, orange, and sometimes even some purple.
Croton Dreadlocks: The narrow, curly leaves of a croton “dreadlocks” hang down like bunches of long hair in colors ranging from dark green to red to green leaves with yellow specks.
Croton Revolution: The curling, narrow leaves of this croton are usually dark green with a few yellow dots.

Leaf Loss: Can be caused by over watering, severe under watering, temperature too low
Loss of  Leaf Color: Leaves may revert to all green when there is not enough light
Plants pests: If the color in the leaves looks faded, check for spider mites
A croton plant is a little temperamental and not as forgiving as some other houseplants; but are a bright addition to any home or office if you remember a few important are tips:
Warm temperature and high humidity if possible
Water less and do not fertilize in winter
Wash leaves often and examine for spider mites
Croton plants are poisonous and must be kept away from children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that could harm children and pets in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a croton plant: Very bright, indirect light is necessary for the leaves to stay colorful. When there is not enough light, new leaves are green and not predominantly yellow, red, or orange. Too much direct sun causes phototoridation, a condition that causes gray and dull looking leaves.
Allow the top 25%-30% of the soil to dry out before watering. The hard, leathery leaves become soft and flexible when a croton needs water. When the plant is over watered or severely under watered, leaves drop off.
How to fertilize a croton plant: Fertilize monthly in the spring and fall and every two weeks in the summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If your croton is in a bright sunny spot, but the new leaves are coming in green, reduce the amount of plant food. Too much fertilizer also causes leaf curl.
Warm temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C) are best for a croton. If the temperature drops below 50°F (10°C) leaves may drop off.
High humidity helps a croton plant grow faster and look better. but also encourages plant diseases. This plant still grows well in basic, household humidity.
Croton flowers are small and inconsequential. I recommend removing them as soon as they appear so they don’t drain the plant’s energy and hinder leaf development.
Croton plant pests: Mealy bugs, scale, and fungus gnats can all be a problem, but it’s spider mites that do the most damage. Because of the multi-colored leaves, it is often difficult to see spider mites on a croton. These plant pests suck the color from the leaves and ruin the plant appearance. Treat a spider mite problem by thoroughly spraying the inexpensive, non toxic “Green Solution” (recipe in the Glossary) once a month as a preventative measure. See a picture and learn how to identify and treat mealy bugs, scale, fungus gnats, and spider mites in the Glossary of the website.
Fungal and bacteria infections may occur because of the humid environment and moist soil a croton plant requires. The most common diseases to look out for are powdery mildew and leaf spot disease. See a picture and read more about these diseases in the Glossary of the website.
Use a rich potting soil that drains well, but still retains water. for a croton plant.
When to repot a croton plant: Re-pot when the roots have filled the existing container; use the next size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can drain out; and never allow the plant to sit in the excess water.
How to prune a croton plant: Trim the stem tips to encourage new growth and keep the plant bushy and full.
A croton plant can be propagated using stem cuttings or by air layering. Individual leaves can be rooted and used in dish gardens. You can read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Crotons are very poisonous plants with a #3 toxicity level. They are toxic to small children, cats, dogs, and other pets so please keep them well out of reach.
Croton leaf color develops best in a bright but cool location. Move your plant to a location that is not quite as warm and reduce the amount fertilizer you are using.
Croton plants are extremely poisonous houseplants. The sap from a Croton Plant will irritate your skin and stain your clothes. More importantly, a croton has a #3 toxicity level, which means ingesting any part of the plant can cause serious digestive and respiratory problems.
I recommend removing the croton flower and its stalk as soon as possible. Flowering hinders leaf production and the sap from the flowers may cause plant diseases and attract plant pests.
Since the roots are probably still intact, I think you may be able to save your croton. Cut the bare stems back to about 2” above the soil. Move your plant to a bright location and keep the barely soil moist but not soggy. Use a product called superthrive every time you water. Be patient, the plant should eventually look better than ever.
The fine webbing indicates that your croton has spider mites, a very harmful plant pest that sucks the color from the plant leaves. Spray your croton with the ” green solution.” This is a mixture of 1/2 water,1/2 alcohol, a few drops of mineral oil, and a few drops of biodegradable soap. Repeat the spraying in 10 days."
86,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Areca Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/areca-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Areca palm, Dypsis lutescens, is part of the Arecaceae family (also known as Palmae).  Sold both as a large, fast-growing outdoor plant for warm climates and an inexpensive, large indoor plant, the Areca palm is  native to Madagascar. It can now be found growing in tropical and sub-tropical regions such as Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Hawaii. As an outdoor plant, the fronds of an Areca palm can be 6ft-7ft long (2-3m) and the height of the plant as tall as 20-40ft (2m-12m). In nature, it produces yellow flowers during the summer months, but rarely blooms as a houseplant
An Areca palm is a type of cane palm. When grown indoors, an immature Areca palm can be small enough to sit on a table or desk. However, as the plant matures, it quickly develops into a medium sized, exotic looking palm that can reach a height of 6-8 feet. An Areca palm gets its nickname, the “Butterfly Palm” because of the way its long, feathery fronds (leaves) arch upwards off multiple reed- like stems, resembling butterfly wings. Each frond has between 40-60 leaflets and may be as tall as 3ft.
Provide bright, indirect light
Keep the soil barely moist
Do not over fertilize
Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) can damage the leaves
Never remove the growing point at the end of a stem or the entire frond may die
High humidity helps the plant look better and grow faster
An Areca Palm is a very popular indoor plant. It’s is an excellent “clean air”plant that rids the air of harmful pollutants and safe to have around pets and small children. However, the appearance of the plant deteriorates without the proper light, water quality, and humidity. Follow the care tips below and your Areca Palm should stay looking good for may years.
How much light for an Areca Palm: Bright indirect light; too much light or direct sun burns the fronds and causes them to turn yellow.
How to water an Areca Palm: Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy. Allow the top few inches of the soil to dry out before watering. Remember, the soil at the bottom of the container is wetter than the soil at the top. Never allow an Areca Palm to sit in the excess water that drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. If your household water has a lot of chemicals in it or passes through a water softener, allow the water to sit out over-night before using it, or use distilled water or rain water. Water containing chemicals or salt may cause ugly spots on the leaves. A Areca palm develops yellow leaves if the soil gets too dry.
How to fertilize an Areca Palm: Feed monthly when the plant is actively growing with a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Too much fertilizer damages the leaves.
Best temperature for an Areca Palm: 65F°-75F° (18.3°C-23.9°) during the day and around 55°F (12.8°C) at night. Areca palms are very sensitive to low temperatures so if you place it outside during the summer be sure to bring it in before temperatures dip below 50°F (10°C).
Humidity for an Areca Palm: High humidity is essential to keep the fronds looking good and prevent them from turning brown. Interestingly, you should not cut off brown tips due to dry air that may develop on the leaves, doing so slows down the growth of the plant.
Does an Areca Palm flower: When grown outdoors, the plant may produce bunches of yellow flowers. An indoor Areca palm rarely blooms.
Areca Palm plant pests: Spider mites and mealy bugs can be a problem. Check frequently for plant pests by examining the backs of the fronds and new growth. If your Areca palm has an insect problem, spray the fronds with warm soapy water or an insecticidal soap; dilute the insecticidal soap to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never use a commercial insecticide; it will severely damage the fronds of a palm.
Areca Palm plant diseases: Because the plant prefers high humidity, an Areca Palm is susceptible to fungus infections. Diseases can develop in moist soil and cause the fronds in the crown (top) of the palm to turn brown and droop; or, they may cause lower fronds to droop and turn yellow. Providing good air circulation helps prevent fungus infections.
Best soil for an Areca Palm: Use a rich acidic soil that drains well. Add some builder’s sand to your potting mix if the soil seems too heavy or clay- like.
What size pot for an Areca Palm: This plant likes to be a little root-bound, so don’t rush to repot. When the roots have filled the current container, it’s time to move an Areca Palm to the next size pot and nothing larger. There must always be drip holes in the bottom of the pot.
How to prune an Areca Palm: Remove any brown or yellow fronds at the base of the stem near the soil line. Do not try to trim the brown tips at the ends of a frond. When you trim a leaf, it slows down growth and may actually even kill the leaf. The only growing points on an Areca Palm are at the ends of the stems. If you cut the growing tip off or if it is damaged in any way, the plant stops growing.
How to propagate an Areca Palm: The best way to propagate the plant is by using the “offsets “or “suckers” that grow around the base of a mature palm. Plant division is another good propagation technique. You can read more about both of these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
An Areca Palm is a “clean air” plant that is effective in removing benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene from the air.
An Areca Palm is non-poisonous plant and safe to have around cats, dogs, or small children.
Your Areca must have gotten very dry while you were gone. Cut off the discolored fronds and water well. Add a few drops of superthrive to the water for an extra little boost.
The tips of the fronds turn brown when the plant is over watered, when it is over fertilized, or if there is salt, chlorine, or fluoride in the water. Allow the top 1-2″ of soil to dry out before watering and use distilled water if your water passes through a softener or has any chemicals in it.
The webbing is from the spider mites attacking your palm. If you don’t get rid of them, they will suck the color out of your plant leaving unsightly yellow blotches. Spray your plant with a good insecticidal soap at 1/2 the recommended strength. Be sure to treat both sides of the fronds and all of the stems."
87,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Ponytail Palm Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/ponytail-palm-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Ponytail Palm is not really a palm at all, but a relative of the yucca and lily plants and a member of the agave family. This is a unique succulent; there are no two ponytail palms that are exactly alike. A Ponytail Palm has a large, swollen base that some say resembles an elephant’s foot. The thin trunk is topped with flat, dark green, grass-like leaves. The leaves are about an inch wide and often five to six ft. long;  the edges can be quite sharp. A Ponytail Palm, sometimes referred to as a Bottle Palm or Elephant’s Foot Palm, is a slow growing, very different looking plant that thrives on neglect. Put this plant in bright light, water sparingly, and watch it grow.
A Ponytail Palm grows best in very bright indirect light or full sun. In proper growing conditions, it can reach a height of up to 8ft.
Over- watering is about the only way to kill a Ponytail Palm. Allow the top 50-70% of the soil to dry out before watering. During the warm months you may need to water every 7-14 days; in winter, only every three or four weeks. A Ponytail Palm stores water in its base and is very drought resistant. These plants can get brown leaf dips when they are over or under watered. However, when in doubt, do not water!
Fertilize monthly during the spring and summer with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. If the soil is very dry, use plain water first, then use water containing plant food. This prevents the fertilizer from burning the roots and causing brown leaf tips.
Ponytail Palms like warm temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C). They can survive lower temperatures, but don’t grow as well. These plants, unlike other exotic tropical houseplants, like dry hot heat.
A Ponytail Palm needs very little humidity and does well in warm dry air.
Mealy bugs, spider mites, and scale may infest a Ponytail Palm, especially the new growth. Spray with the green solution diluted to ½ strength (recipe in Glossary).
The soil of a Ponytail Palm needs to dry out. Use a fast draining, light soil with a lot of sand in it; this helps prevent over-watering and root rot.
If you want to keep a Pony Tail Palm small keep it in a small pot. When you move it to a larger pot, the trunk can expand and the PonyTail Palm grows faster.
Trim the brown ends off the leaves with a wet scissors.
Propagate by separating the offsets or suckers that grow around the base of the plant. Read more about this type of propagation in the Glossary of the website.
A Ponytail Palm is a non-poisonous plant.
Brown leaves and a wrinkled base usually mean the plant needs more water. Gradually start to water a little more frequently, using a little more water each time. Be careful not to over water. A Ponytail Palm can survive for a long time being under watered, but only very briefly being over watered.
Once you cut the top off of your Ponytail Palm, several new heads will start to grow from that area. These new heads will give your Ponytail Palm an even more interesting appearance. Most people don’t have much luck planting the cut portion of the plant; but it’s always worth a try. Be sure to dip the top of the Ponytail Palm into Rooting Hormone before you plant it to encourage the new roots.
Soft and mushy heads that fall over on a Ponytail Palm indicate over-watering. Cut off the dead head and any part of the stem that seems soft and mushy. Don’t water for at least a month or more until you see new heads with green leaves starting to emerge from the trunk.
Brown tips on a Bottle Palm or Ponytail Palm can mean several things: over -watering is the most serious, under-watering, too much plant food, using water that has passed through a softener and is too salty.
Ponytail Palms like to be root bound. If you want to keep your plant short, keep it in a small pot. If you want the Ponytail Palm to grow faster, repot it once a year; always go up only one pot size. The larger the pot the bigger the plant becomes. A Ponytail Palm may reach a height of 8ft. indoors."
88,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Boston Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/boston-fern-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Boston fern (Nephrolepis exalta) is native to tropical forests and swamp areas around the world. These ferns are especially prevalent in Florida, Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Polynesia. Indoor ferns are not that difficult to grow, but they cannot be ignored and are not as forgiving as some other houseplants. High humidity and keeping the soil barely moist are two keys to success. In addition to the Boston fern, the easiest ferns to grow indoors are the Kimberly Queen fern, the Rabbit’s Foot fern, and the Bird’s Nest fern.
The wide- spreading Boston fern, with its long, arching fronds looks beautiful in hanging baskets. The fronds or leaves can be 2-3 feet long and 4-6 inches wide. Each frond has small leaflets (pinnae) on either side of a midrib. The leaflets have slightly serrated edges and a deltoid shape.
Other ferns that belong to the Nephrolepis family and resemble the Boston fern are:
Fluffy Ruffle Fern or Feather Fern that has leathery leaflets with ruffled edges arranged in a double herringbone pattern.
Lace Fern has lacy leaflets arranged in a triple herringbone pattern.
Kimberly Queen Fern or Australian Sword Fern is more compact and neater than a Boston fern, and has erect, narrow, sword- shaped fronds.
                   
Lace Fern                  Fluffy Ruffle Fern          Kimberly Queen Fern
The special special problems that a Boston fern, and other indoor ferns have, are easily solved if you know what is causing them.
A Boston fern is a clean air plant and helps remove removing formaldehyde from the air. It loves to vacation outside in the shade when the weather is warm but not too hot. Remember to bring it indoors before nighttime temperatures go below 50°F (10°C). A Boston fern is a non-poisonous plant safe to have around small children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
How much light does a Boston fern need: Bright, indirect light helps the plant grow well. Placing a Boston fern in front of a window with a northern exposure allows it to get sufficient light, but not so much that the leaves lose their vibrant green color. Keep the plant out of direct sun.
How much water for a Boston fern: Allow the top 30% of the soil to dry-out before watering. The fronds or leaves may turn a pale green which indicates the fern needs water. Yellow, limp, rotting fronds, especially in the center of a Boston fern, mean the plant is being over-watered. Crispy leaves indicate the fern needs more water. Using “hard water” causes unsightly white marks on the fronds. A Boston fern is more drought-resistant than most ferns, so when in doubt, don’t water.
How to fertilize a Boston fern: Feed monthly when the plant is actively growing with a balanced, liquid fertilizer. Dilute the plant food 1/4 to 1/2 the recommended strength to prevent the ends of the fronds from turning brown due to fertilizer burn.
Best temperature for a Boston fern: Temperature should be 60°-70°F (15.6-21.1°C). Keep all varieties of indoor ferns away from heat sources such as fireplaces and heaters. If the temperature drops below 50°F (10°C) or goes above 90°F (32.2°C), it may damage the leaves.
How much humidity does a Boston fern need: All ferns grow best in high humidity, and a Boston fern is no exception. Unless you live in the tropics, high humidity is rarely found in our homes or offices. If the air is dry and the tips of the fronds are turning brown, try setting your fern on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the fern is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. You can also put a humidifier in the room, or cluster plants together to create a mini greenhouse effect.
Boston fern plant pests: Aphids, mealy bugs, scale, and spider mites can be a problem. Since pesticides damage fern fronds, spray often with a mild, soapy water solution to prevent and treat pest infestations.
Boston fern plant diseases: These plants are fairly disease resistant. Over- watering, resulting in root rot, is the main problem to keep an eye out for.
Best soil for a Boston fern: Use a good, indoor potting soil mixed with a little extra peat moss to help it drain quickly.
Pot size for a Boston fern: Ferns grow well when root-bound. Repot to the next size pot, and nothing larger, when the roots of the plant have filled the existing pot. When in doubt, do not re-pot. Do not fertilize a Boston fern for several weeks after re-potting.
How to prune a Boston fern: Cut dead fronds off at the base of the stem. Dead leaves on any houseplant should be immediately removed since they drain energy from the plant.
How to propagate a Boston fern: The best and easiest way to propagate is by plant division. Use a sharp, serrated knife to cut the fern root- ball in half or in quarters. Plant the cut sections in small pots only 1″-2″ larger than the root ball. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape. Read more about how to propagate a plant by plant division in the Glossary of the website.
Does a Boston fern clean the air: These ferns are clean air plants and do an excellent job removing formaldehyde from the air.
Is a Boston fern Poisonous: Ferns are non-poisonous and are safe to have around small children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
Ferns do best when the temperature is cool (60°-70°F). The top of a refrigerator is not a good place because it gets too hot.
The tips of the fronds or leaves on a Boston Fern, and other ferns, may turn brown for several reasons: There is not enough humidity the air. The water you are using contains too much chlorine or fluoride. You are using water that has passed through a softener and is too salty. You are over feeding the plant and the salt in the excess plant food is burning the plant.
It sounds like you Boston fern has Mealy Bugs. However, since the fronds of a Boston fern are delicate, you have to be careful what you spray on the plant to get rid of the Mealy Bugs. Spray your Boston Fern with warm soapy water or diluted insecticidal soap to get rid of Mealy Bugs. You may have to spray the plant several times to completely get rid of the problem."
89,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/9,Sago Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/sago-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Sago palm, Cycad, is not really a palm at all; and although it resembles a true palm, it is not even a close relative. These plants are a type of gymnosperm and relatives of conifers and gingko trees. Cycads, often called “living fossils,” are one of the oldest most primitive plant families and have not changed very much in the last 200 million years. A Sago palm has several common names such as King Sago, Sago Cycad, and Japanese Sago Palm.  An interesting fact is that although these plants produce nuts, they never produce flowers or fruit. The only Sago palm sold as an indoor plant is the Cycas revoluta.
A Sago Palm has a very rugged trunk 1”- 12” (2.54cm – 30.50cm)  in width depending upon the age of the plant. The trunk is topped with stiff, somewhat narrow, long, arching fronds that grow in a circular or rosette pattern. Be careful to avoid being stuck by the sharp, needle-like tips of the fronds. This is a very elegant, slow growing plant and often produces only one new frond per year. Although outdoors a Sago palm can reach a height of 6ft. (1.8 m), indoors a mature Sago palm, after five or six years, is still only about 2ft – 3ft tall (.6m-.9m).
This plant grows well indoors if you keep a few things in mind.
Sago palms need bright, indirect light but no afternoon sun.
Be careful not to over water or the plant can quickly die
Use  a sandy soil that drains quickly.
A Sago palm likes to be warm and grows better in high humidity.
A Sago palm is toxic to cats, dogs, and humans. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a Sago palm: A Sago palm needs bright light with a little direct sun in the morning. Direct afternoon sun burns the leaves. Give a Sago palm a ¼ turn each week to keep it from growing toward the light. In bright light a Sago palm produces short thick fronds, in lower light the fronds are long and narrow.
How to water a Sago palm: A Sago palm is fairly drought resistant plant. It is more harmful to the plant to over water and cause root rot than to under water. Allow the top 75% of the soil to dry out before thoroughly watering a Sago Palm. Be sure the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot, but do not allow the plant to sit in the excess water. Water sparingly in the winter when there is less light and cooler temperatures. Be careful to never get water in the crown of a Sago palm, this can cause Crown Rot disease and the eventual death of the plant. Sago palms should never be allowed to totally dry out.
How to fertilize a Sago palm: Feed a Sago palm monthly from spring through fall with a liquid fertilizer (18-6-18) diluted to ½ the recommended strength. To avoid leaf tip burn, be sure the spot of the plant is slightly damp when you fertilizer The fronds of a Sago Palm shrivel and dry up if it has been over-fertilized.
Best temperature for a Sago palm: Sago palms prefer warm temperatures between 60°-75° F (16°-24° C). They still survive in temperatures as low 45° F (7.2°C) but do not grow at all. Avoid putting a Sago palm near heaters, air conditioners, or cold drafts. These plants do not like severe temperature fluctuations.
Humidity for a Sago palm: A Sago Palm likes high humidity so you may need to place a humidifier near the palm if the air in your home is very dry. Although Sago Palms can survive in low humidity, they do not grow well or look very good.
Does a Sago palm flower: Although a Sago palm produces nuts, it does not produce flowers or fruit.
Sago palm plant pests: Scale and mealy bugs are the main plant pests that bother a Sago palm. Like all other indoor palms, the fronds of a Sago palm are easily damaged by commercial pesticides. Use Neem Oil or an insecticidal soap to treat plant pests. Read more about how to identify and treat scale and mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Sago palm plant diseases: Be careful not to get water on the center crown of the plant where the leaves emerge. Crown Rot plant disease occurs when water gets on the crown of a Sago palm. There is no treatment for Crown Rot and the plant often dies. Root rot caused by over watering is the mail reason an indoor Sago palm dies.
Soil for a Sago palm: A palm needs a loose soil that drains quickly. Use a cactus or succulent soil for a Sago palm.
What size pot for a Sago palm: The roots of a Sago palm do not like to be disturbed, so repot only when the plant has totally outgrown the existing pot. You can control the height of a Sago palm by keeping it in a small pot.
How to prune a Sago palm: Remove dead or damaged fronds that have turned completely brown from a Sago Palm by cutting them off at the very bottom of the plant.
How to propagate a Sago palm: Mature Sago Palms produce offsets, called pups, which are used for propagation. When you remove a pup from around the base of a Sago Palm, be sure to take all of the leaves and roots. A sago palm can also be propagated by plant division. Read more about both of these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
Is a Sago palm a poisonous plant: A Sago palm is a very poisonous houseplant with a #4 level toxicity. All parts are poisonous, especially the seeds. Keep a Sago palm out of the reach of children, dogs, and especially cats who love to play with the fronds of the plant.
First remove the pup with all of its leaves & roots. Set it aside for a week so any cut areas can dry out. Gently plant the pup in a small pot of loose quick draining soil or cactus mix; 1/2 the trunk should be below the soil level. Water well. Almost all of the soil should be dry before you water again. Place the new plant in a bright area in your home or a shady area outside. Be patient, it may be several months before any new leaves appear.
Sago Palms are very slow growing plants . They do not constantly add new fronds. Sagos do eventually produce what is called a “flush” of new leaves. This is called a “break”. These new leaves are very fragile and easily damaged during the first few weeks. Feeding it more will only burn the existing leaves.
Yellow leaves on a Sago Palm are usually due to a watering problem or too much fertilizer. Old fronds turn yellow from too much water or too much plant food. New fronds start to turn yellow when the soil is lacking in certain nutrients or from too much plant food."

As a houseplant, the easy to care for marble queen pothos, also called Devil’s Ivy,” grows well in many different locations throughout your home. Its long, cascading, draping vines look beautiful decorating a table, hanging gracefully in a basket, or set in wall planter.  A marble queen pothos can also be trained to climb a bark or peat moss pole.
As an outdoor plant, the vines on a marble queen pothos can grow 50ft – 60ft ( 15m-18m) long, using aerial roots and thick stems to cling to trees and other surfaces. The leaves can be as large as 35” (90cm) long and 16”-18” (40.6cm – 45.7cm) wide.  As a houseplant, a marble queen pothos is a much smaller plant with thick, waxy, green, and white, heart – shaped leaves that are usually 4”- 6” (10cm- 15cm) long and 2”- 3” (5cm -7.6cm) wide. The long vines, if left untrimmed, grow 6ft (1.8m) or more in length.

Easy to propagate using stem tip cuttings.
Aggressively prune the ends of long vines to keep plant full and bushy.
Jade pothos has solid green, leathery, heart shaped leaves.
Golden pothos has green and yellow, leathery, heart shaped leaves.
Neon pothos has bright chartreuse, heart shaped leaves that get darker as the plant matures.
Pearls and Jade pothos (a marble queen variant) grows more slowly, has smaller leaves, and the white highlights are along the edges of the leaves.
N’Joy pothos resembles the Pearls & Jade variety; the small, green leaves have a cream and yellow design.
Snow Queen pothos has more white in its leaves than a Marble Queen pothos.
Glacier pothos has smaller, more rounded, white and green marbled leaves.

A Marble Queen Pothos is a popular, hardy, fast growing, attractive plant that is perfect for someone just starting to care for houseplants. Although it is a “clean air plant” that removes harmful chemicals from the air, a Marble Queen pothos is also a poisonous plant and should be kept away from pets and small children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants .
A marble queen pothos survives in low light but looks better and grows faster in medium to bright indirect light. When the light is too low, the white swirls on the leaves revert to green on the new growth.
Marble queen pothos like their soil to be kept on the dry side. During the spring and summer, water well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. During the fall and winter, let the soil get almost totally dry before watering. If in doubt, wait for the leaves to become soft and droop a little before you water. Black leaves indicate over watering while bright yellow leaves mean the plant has gotten a bit too dry before you watered.
Feed every other month with a plant food high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
The best temperature is between 65°F-85°F (18.3°C-29.4°C) The leaves may be damaged if the temperature drops below 55°F ( 12.8°C).
Marble Queen pothos grow well in basic household humidity.
All pothos plants are relatively pest free. Thrips and mealy bugs may be a problem and can be treated with the “Green solution” (recipe in the Glossary the website).
Bacterial leaf spot disease causes dark spots with yellow halos. Keeping the leaves dry helps prevent bacterial diseases. Root rot and stem rot fungal diseases cause stems and roots to become mushy and die. These problems need to be treated with a commercial fungicide and correcting how you are watering the plant.
Use a well-aerated, quick-draining potting soil; if the soil is heavy and doesn’t drain well, add a little sand to the mix.
A marble queen pothos likes to be root-bound in a small pot. When the roots have filled the existing pot, move to the NEXT size pot and nothing larger.
Aggressively trim the long vines every few months to keep your plant full and bushy. You can use the stem tip clippings to easily start new plants.
Stem Cuttings are a very simple way to propagate a marble queen pothos and all other pothos varieties.
All varieties of pothos plants clean the air of harmful chemicals.
A marble queen pothos is very poisonous with a #2 toxicity level. Pets that eat stems or leaves of the plant may exhibit vomiting, pawing at the mouth, lack of appetite, and drooling.
Your marble queen pothos is not getting enough light to maintain the white variation in its leaves. Move your plant to a brighter location and the new leaves should be white and green again.
The temperature in your sunroom may be getting too cold for a marble queen pothos especially at night. Cut off the damaged leaves and move your plant to a warmer location.
Sounds like you are over watering your marble queen pothos and the stems and perhaps the roots are rotting. Cut off all of the dead or dying stems and do not water again until the soil has totally dried out.
Yellow leaves occur on a pothos plant when you allow the soil to dry out too much before you water. The plant can droop a little, but be sure to water it well before it has drooped too much."

This is a hardy, almost impossible to kill houseplant that thrives on neglect.  Sansevieria plants can grow in bright light or shade, are not harmed by low humidity or cold drafts, rarely need to be repotted, and are drought resistant. The only way to kill a sansevieria is by over watering or keeping it in temperatures 40°F ( 4.4°C) or less for aa extended period of time
A Sansevieria plant can be used as a table plant when small, or a stately floor plant as it mature.  The leaves are arranged and grow in a rosette pattern. Sansevieria plants developed hard, leathery leaves to adapt to the dry, arid regions where they were originally found growing. The thick, succulent leaves store water and the thick leaf cuticles help to reduce the loss of moisture. The flowers of a sansevieria  are usually greenish-white and grow atop a long, leafless stem. Flowering usually occurs during the summer or fall.
1. S. Trifasciata is the most popular variety sold. It has long, sword-like, succulent leaves that grow about 2-3ft tall. The many trifasciata types include the S. Futuro            Robusta” that has grayish green muted patterns on the leaves; and the S. laurentii with variegated leaves that have bright golden edges;
2. S. Zelanica is a bit shorter than the trifasciata and has dark green leaves with creamy white horizontal pattern.
3.  S. Hahnii varieties have thick, compact, very short (4”) rosettes of fleshy leaves. The Golden Hahnii and the Silver Hahnii are two popular varieties.
4.  S. Cylindrica is a stemless plant with stiff, tall, narrow, grey-green leaves that have  horizontal, dark green stripes.
5.  S. Braided Cylindrica is created by gently braiding the tall, narrow stems of S. Cylindrica and then gathering the tops of the stems together with a decorative tie.

A sansevieria plant is one of those plants that can only be killed with too much kindness and attention. It is perfect for someone who loves having plants in their home, but doesn’t have the time (or interest) to constantly care for them. The only thing to remember is do not over water!
These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants, 
How much light does a sansevieria need: This plant can be placed anywhere in a room, from the darkest corner to the brightest window. The better the light, the faster a sansevieria plant grows. The more coloration in the leaves, the more light the plant needs.
How to water a sansevieria plant: Over-watering is the main reason a sansevieria plant dies. Allow the soil to practically dry out before you water. During the winter, in a low light area, a sansevieria plant may need water only once every month or two.
How to feed a sansevieria plant: Fertilize monthly when the plant is actively growing with a cactus plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never use a fertilizer that contains nitrates.
Best temperature for a sansevieria plant: Sansevierias grow well in warm temperatures between 60°F (15.5°C) and 85° F (29°C)
Does a sansevieria plant need high humidity: Low humidity or basic household humidity is fine for a sansevieria plant.
Does a sansevieria plant flower: When the conditions are right, a sansevieria plant may produce flowers every few years during the spring and summer. Flower production occurs when the plant is in bright light and experiencing some stress; stress might be severely dry soil or being root-bound in a small pot. The flowers appear as clusters on long spikes. Sansevieria flowers are fragrant but not particularly pretty.
Sansevieria plant pests: Mealy bugs and spider mites can be a problem. Fortunately they are easily seen on a sansevieria plant and can be quickly treated. Read more about how to identify and treat spider mites and mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Sansevieria plant diseases: Red leaf spot disease causes red spots on the plant leaves. Remove any diseased leaves and spray the plant with a fungicide. Keep the leaves dry and provide good air circulation to prevent red leaf spot disease from reinfecting the plant. Over- watering a sansevieria results in bacterial root rot. Replace the wet soil with dry Sansevieria plant diseases: Red leaf spot disease causes reddish brown spots on the leaves. Remove the diseased leaves, spray the plant with a fungicide, provide good air circulation, and keep the leaves dry. Root rot due to over watering is the main reason a sansevieria plant dies. Get rid of all of the wet soil. Allow the plant to sit out bare root over night. Repot in dry loose soil, and water less. soil and reduce the amount of water you are giving the plant.
Best soil for a sansevieria plant: Use a good, rich, organic soil that drains quickly. If the soil isn’t draining well and appears heavy and clay-like, add some builders sand.
What size pot does a sansevieria plant need: Keep a sansevieria root bound in a small pot with drip holes in the bottom. This helps a sansevieria flower more often and prevents over watering.
How to prune a sansevieria plant: Use a sharp, sterile knife to remove leaves that are too tall or damaged in any way. Be careful not to damage the smaller leaves that are still growing.
How to propagate a sansevieria plant: Plant division, leaf cuttings, and using the offsets that grow around the base of the plant are the best propagation methods. When using cuttings or offsets, always allow the cut ends to dry out for a few days before planting it.
Is a sansevieria a clean air plant: All varieties of a sansevieria are excellent clean air plants. They have been shown to remove benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.
Is a sansevieria plant poisonous: A sansevieria is a mildly poisonous plant with a #1 level toxicity. It is toxic to dogs, cats, and small children.
A Sansevieria Plant, in bright light and under stressful conditions (pot-bound or very dry), may produce flowers every few years. The Sansevieria Plant sends out long spikes filled with numerous small fragrant white or cream-colored flowers. These flowers won’t slow the plants growth or shape, so enjoy them.
Brown mushy leaves on a Sansevieria Plant means you over-watering your Plant. Remove all of the damaged leaves and re-pot the plant into a smaller container with new DRY soil. Place your Sansevieria in a warm sunny location and don’t water until the soil is totally dry.
There are a couple of ways to propagate a Mother in Law’s Tongue. The easiest way is by plant division. You can also use leaf cuttings to propagate a Sansevieria Plant. When using leaf cuttings, cut some leaves into 4” segments, allow the cut ends to dry out for a few days, then plant two or three segments per small pot.
Sansevierias are sometimes referred to as a ” Mother in Law’s Tongue Plant” because the leaves are long, sharp, and pointed. If you happen to nibble on one of the leaves, your mouth may become numb. People who don’t get along with their Mother- in- Law find a connection with this description."
92,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Majesty Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/majesty-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"I have to admit that a Majesty Palm, sometimes referred to as a Majestic Palm, is not a plant I recommend to those just beginning to care for houseplants. They are a challenge to take care of and are not very forgiving. Majesty Palms, native to Madagascar, do extremely well outdoors in rain forests, swamps, or in tropical areas such as Florida. In nature they can grow as tall as eighty feet. Indoors, a Majesty Palm often struggles to survive and does not do as well as a bamboo palm, neanthebella palm, kentia palm, or parlor palm.
For its size, a Majesty palm, Ravenea Rivularis, is a relatively inexpensive plant with large, feathery, arching green fronds on several stems. Although a slow growing plant, in the proper indoor location, it can grow as tall as 8ft. This palm is a species of tree in the Arecaceae family, not to be confused with the Araceae  family that contains poisonous plants such as the dieffenbachia, Calla Lily, Caladium, and Anthurium.
The proper amount of light, water, humidity, and fertilizer are four of the key factors that help a majesty palm do well as an indoor plant.
Provide plenty of bright indirect light. If you don’t have a spot in your home that has bright light and still want a palm, consider a bamboo palm which grows well in much lower light.
Never allow the soil to totally dry out. Unlike a dracaena which forgives you if you forget to water,  a Majesty Palm shows its displeasure by quickly getting brown fronds.
Feed twice a month when your Majesty Palm is actively growing. These are very hungry plants and skimping on fertilizer results in yellow fronds.
This plant does best in high humidity
Although it looks beautiful when first purchased, a Majesty Palm quickly declines if not properly cared for. The large fronds turn yellow and spider mites find a happy home hidden in the fronds. If you’re not easily frustrated and really want to test your plant skills, check out the detailed plant care tips below and give a Majesty Palm a try.
A Majesty Palm needs very bright indirect light at all times. Inadequate light causes yellow fronds (leaves).
The soil of a Majesty Palm should be consistently moist but not soggy. Never let the soil totally dry out or allow the plant to sit in the excess water that drains out. Brown tips and fronds are telling you that the plant needs more water. Yellow leaf tips mean the plant has been over-watered.
These plants require a great deal of plant food. Not enough fertilizer is another cause of yellow leaves. Feed a Pajesty palm every two weeks when the plant is actively growing with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a Majesty Palm is between 45°F-85°F ( 7.2°C-29.4°C). Try to keep the plant away from cold drafts or heating vents.
A Majesty Palm looks better and grows faster when there is a lot of humidity in the air.
Spider mites are the main pest problem for a Majesty Palm. Spraying the fronds with warm, soapy water every few weeks helps prevent spider mites. If these pests do appear, spray the palm with neem oil or an insecticidal soap. Commercial insecticides should never be used on palm plants.
The high humidity Majesty Palm prefers encourages bacterial and fungal infections. Keep the fronds dry, do not mist the plant, and provide good air circulation around a Majesty Palm.
Use a rich soil that drains quickly for a Majesty Palm. When using a basic houseplant soil, try adding some sand to help it drain better.
Majesty Palms are large plants usually sold in 10″ pots or larger.
How to prune a Majesty palm: Fertilize about 7-10 days before you plan to prune a Majesty Palm; this encourages new growth at the pruning site. Quickly prune any yellow fronds or those that show signs of fungal or bacterial infection. Pruning should be done at the base of the frond stem. Always use very sharp scissors or cutting shears when pruning any houseplant.
A Majesty Palm is usually propagated from seeds. Since these plants are inexpensive, it’s easier to let the experts handle propagation.
A Majesty Palm is a non-poisonous plant and is not toxic to cats, dogs, or children.
Unless your garage has a lot of windows with a Southern exposure, you can’t store your Majesty Palm in a garage for the winter. Majesty Palms must have bright light throughout most of the day.
You should never use water that passes through a water softener on any of your houseplants, especially Palms. Water from a softener contains a great deal of salt that damages plant leaves. A Majesty Palm may not be the right choice as a “first plant.” Majesty Palms require quite a bit of care. Don’t get discouraged if your palm doesn’t do well just try a hardier houseplant next time.
Leaf tippage on a Majesty Palm can be caused by many things: not enough humidity, insufficient magnesium in the fertilizer, too much or not enough water, direct rather than indirect bright light, or simply because it’s a Majesty Palm and it’s not really supposed to be an indoor plant.
The fronds of a Majesty Palm turn yellow for many reasons: not enough light, not enough water, or not enough fertilizer. Unlike most houseplants, a Majesty Palm requires an excessive amount of all three.
The green solution that I recommend for treating houseplant pests contains alcohol. Alcohol burns and discolors the leaves of Palm Trees. Spray warm soapy water on the fronds of your palm Trees to help prevent Spider Mites. Use Neem Oil on your Palm Trees to get rid of the Spider Mites if your Palm Trees becomes infested."
93,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Wandering Jew Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/wandering-jew-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Wandering Jew plant, Tradescantia , is a fast growing, easy to care for plant that looks beautiful hanging in front of a window that gets bright, indirect light but no direct sun. Popular nicknames are “Inch Plant” or Spiderwort. Originally found growing as a 1-2ft tall wildflower in Canada and all the way south to Argentina, today a wandering jew plant is both a popular indoor and outdoor plant throughout the world.
The wandering jew plant group is made up of several different varieties. Most have long vines of 2″-4″ oval or heart shaped leaves. Leaf color depends upon the exact type and can be solid green, green with a purple stripe, green with a white or yellow stripe, green with splashes of pink, purple, and cream, or solid purple. The back of the leaf may also be purple. Some wandering jew plants have hairy leaves and some with a silver shine to them. The wandering jew plant produces small flowers in white, pink, purple, or magenta.
The five varieties most commonly used as indoor plants are the Tradescantia zebrina, Tradescantia fluminensis, Tradescantia sillamontana, Tradesantia pallida, and the Tradescantia blossfeldiana.. All types of Wandering Jew plants are easily propagated using stem tip cuttings.

Bright light essential for colorful leaves
Reduce water in winter
Repot in the spring if necessary
Avoid temperatures below 45°F ( 7.4°C)
Propagate using stem cuttings
Prune aggressively to keep plant bushy
Brown leaf tips: air too dry or spider mites
Limp stems and yellow leaves: plant needs more water
Variegated varieties turn solid green: plant need more light
The sap of a wandering jew plant is slightly toxic to small children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light does a Wandering Jew plant need: Bright indirect light helps the plant produce colorful leaves and flowers. Direct sun causes the color in the leaves to fade.
How to water a Wandering Jew plant: Water well and then allow the top 2″ to 3″ of soil dry out before watering again. If the soil is very dry and the plant is sitting in bright light, the leaves become stunted and lose color. Lack of water can also cause brown and crispy leaves on a Wandering Jew plant. This usually problem affects to older growth first. Over watering is more serious, resulting in root rot.
Feed monthly when a Wandering Jew plant is producing new growth with a water-soluble houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. How to fertilize a Wandering Jew plant: Using a plant food high in nitrogen helps the plant produce more colorful leaves. Over-fertilizing causes the bright colors in the leaves to fade.
Best temperature for a Wandering Jew plant: Try to maintain temperatures between 60°- 80°F (15.6°- 26.7°C).
Does a Wandering Jew plant need high humidity: Average to high household humidity is best. If the air is too dry, the leaves of a Wandering Jew plant turn brown. Place a Wandering Jew plant on a tray of wet pebbles to increase the humidity; be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Does a Wandering Jew plant flower: In ideal growing conditions, the plant produces small white, pink, or purple flowers.
Wandering Jew plant pests: Although these plants are fairly pest resistant, aphids, scale, and mealy bugs can be a problem. See pictures of these plant pests and learn how to get rid of them in Glossary of the website.
Wandering Jew plant diseases: The high humidity that helps the plant grow better also encourages fungal and bacterial idiseases
Best soil to use for a Wandering Jew plant: Use a well- aerated soil that drains quickly. If the soil seems heavy and clay-like, add some peat moss and perlite.
What size pot for a Wandering Jew plant: This is a fast growing plant so check the root-ball frequently to see if a larger pot is needed. Repot, when necessary, in the spring. Use the next size pot, nothing larger, and be sure there are drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a Wandering jew plant: When the stems get very long and leggy as the plant matures, don’t hesitate to aggressively prune the plant. When pruning, make the cut above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). It may take a while for the trimmed stems to bush out , so be patient. You can use the stem clippings to propagate new plants.
How to propagate a Wandering Jew plant: Very easy to do, take stem cuttings in the spring, summer,or fall. You can read more about how to propagate a plant using plant cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
A Wandering Jew plant is slightly poisonous with a Level #1 toxicity. It is toxic to dogs, cats, and small children. The sap of the plant is caustic and may cause skin irritations or a rash. It is, however, considered safe to put into bird or reptile enclosures.
If a Wandering Jew plant gets a few hours of direct sun every day, the color in the leaves fades. I’d recommend moving your plant to a different area where it will get bright indirect light.
You probably waited a little too long before pruning your Wandering Jew plant so that’s why it’s still not doing well. Unlike most houseplants, Wandering Jew plants take a long time before starting to produce new leaves. Place your plant in bright indirect light and be patient. You can always use some of the Stem Cuttings to start some new plants.
You are killing your Wandering Jew plant with kindness. A Wandering Jew plant gets brown leaves and mushy stems when it is over-watered and over-fed. This plant needs water when the top few inches of soil are dry. Over- feeding is worse than no food at all. Fertilize monthly with a water soluble plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed only when the plant is producing new leaves. For now, cut off all of the brown leaves and soggy stems and replace the soggy soil with new, fresh, well-aerated soil. Place your Wandering Jew plant in a warm bright area, water carefully, and do not fertilize for at least two months."
94,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Bromeliad Plant- Guzmania,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bromeliad-plant-guzmania/,,,"If you’re tired of buying expensive cut flower arrangements for your dining room table or the reception desk in your office, think about using an easy care Bromeliad plant. There are over 2500 species of bromeliads that are native to North, Central and South America. My favorites varieties of bromeliads are: neoregelia, aechmea, and guzmania. A Bromeliad guzmania plant has long, thin, green. leathery leaves. Brightly colored flowers, really bracts, that can be red, yellow, orange, or even deep purple grow from the center of the plant. You can use a single bromeliad plant or combine three different bromeliads to create your own special arrangement. A bromeliad plant only blooms once indoors, then it’s necessary to propagate a new plant using offsets from the original plant.
         
B. Marjan                       B. Rana                         B. Claret                              B. Sunshine                  B. Queen’s Tears
A bromeliad plant is very adaptable to all types of light, and there is a bromeliad plant variety for every light condition. If your bromeliad plant has thin green leaves it can survive in low light. If a bromeliad plant has thick gray leaves, it needs medium light. The flowers (colorful “bracts”) of a bromeliad plant fade quickly and the leaves turn pale green when it’s placed in very bright light. The leaves of a bromeliad plant get further apart and turn dark green when the plant needs more light.
Bromeliad plants are drought resistant succulents that like dry soil. A bromeliad plant has very small roots and over-watering is the number one reason bromeliad plants die. Some bromeliad plant varieties have “tanks” that like being filled with water; others varieties have fine hairs on their leaves that enjoy being misted.
Feed a bromeliad plant by spraying a liquid fertilizer directly onto the leaves a few times each season. Dilute the plant food 1/2 to 1/4 the recommended strength. Never put fertilizer into the central cup of a bromeliad plant.
Bromeliad plants are tropical plants that can survive in temperatures between 40F°-100°F (4.4C°-37.8°C) but prefer 70F°-75°F (21.1C- 23.9°C) during the day and ten degrees cooler at night. The blooms on a Bromeliad plant last longer when the temperature is cool.
A bromeliad plant grows well in basic household humidity.
Less intense light and cooler temperatures help the bromeliad plant flowers stay colorful longer. Indoors, a bromeliad plant blooms only once. As the bromeliad flower starts to die, the plant produces “pups,” baby plants, around the base of the mother plant. Cut off the dying flower, so the plant can direct its energy to helping the “pups” grow. You can use these “pups” to propagate a new bromeliad plant which will flower in about three years.
Scale and mealy bugs are a pest problem for bromeliads.
Fungal plant diseases such as Crown, Stem and Root Rot, Rust disease, and Leaf Spot disease can infect the Guzmania variety of bromeliads.
Use a light, well-aerated, fast-draining soil for a bromeliad plant. Add sand or perlite to the basic soil mix if the soil seems too heavy.
During the spring, as a bromeliad plant matures and outgrows its existing pot, move the plant to the next size container. After 3 or 4 years, when a bromeliad has reached maturity, it is usually in an 8’ pot. Bromeliad plants like to be root-bound in small pots so don’t rush to put them into a larger container.
A Bromeliad plant rarely needs to be pruned. If leaf tips turn brown, trim them with a sharp, wet scissors.
Once the bromeliad plant flowers die, small plants called “pups” or “offsets” grow around the base of the plant. When these offsets are several inches tall, dig them out, getting as many roots as possible, and plant the baby bromeliads in a 4” pot of loose soil. Be careful not to over-water the new plants while the roots are developing. A newly propagated bromeliad plant usually blooms in 1-3 years.
Bromeliads are non-poisonous houseplants.
The blooms (bracts) on bromeliad plant last longer when the plant is kept in a cool, low light area. The warmer and brighter the room, the more quickly the color in the bromeliad plant flowers fades.
I wouldn’t recommend leaving a bromeliad plant sitting in water. Keeping the roots constantly wet is a perfect way to kill a bromeliad plant. Water well before you leave and place the plant in a cool, low-light area. The bromeliad plant may dry out a bit, but will survive until you return.
I think that putting water in the center cup of a bromeliad plant encourages bacterial and fungus infections. Water a bromeliad plant sparingly around the roots. Avoid using water that has passed through a softener or is high in fluoride, chlorine, or salt for a bromeliad plant."
95,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Dracaena Corn Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-corn-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Dracaena fragrans ‘Massangeana’, or Dracaena Corn plant as it is usually called, is native to the tropical areas of Africa and a close relative of the Dracaena Warnekii (Striped Dracaena), Dracaena Janet Craig, Dracaena marginata, and Dracaena Compacta. It got its nickname “Corn Plant” dracaena, because the main, tall, unbranched stem of the plant resembles the main stalk of a corn plant. This slow growing, easy to care for plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. Although it’s hard to believe, because they look so different, some other members of this family include the Yucca and the Spider plant.
The tall, stately Dracaena Corn plant is a very popular houseplant, often growing taller than 6ft. (1.8 metres). Its long, green, graceful, lance shaped leaves have a one or two yellow or pale green stripes running down the center. The 1”-2” wide leaves grow in a spiral cluster at the top of a thick, central stem. Because of the plants appearance, it, and the Dracaena warnekii and marginata are often mistaken for a type of palm. A mature plant may produce large white flowers atop stalks that drape downwards. The very strong fragrance of the flowers is sometimes overwhelming, especially for people with allergies. Fortunately, the flowers only last about a week. Because of the sticky nectar and abundance of messy pollen the flowers produce, I always cut them off as soon as they appear.
D. fragrans “Tornada” has curled green leaves with a wide lime-coloured edge
 D. fragrans “Malakai” has dark green, light green, and white leaves
D. fragrans “Limelight” leaves are bright yellow/green at first, but, as the plants matures, the leaves turn a light lime-green.

       
D. Limelight               D Malakai                  D. Tornada
Medium to bright, indirect light encourages larger leaves
When in doubt, do not water.
Fluoride in the water can damage the leaves
Never fertilize in the winter
Do not rush to repot; dracaenas like to be root-bound.
Dracaenas are stalk plants. It is natural for bottom leaves to die as new ones develop at the top of the plant.
A Dracaena Corn plant, like all dracaenas, is a very forgiving plant and is tolerant of lower light, missed waterings, and general neglect. Be careful not to kill it with kindness. When small, a Dracaena Corn plant can sit on a table, but its claim to fame is as an impressive 6ft-10ft tree. When purchasing this plant, be sure there are at least three canes in the pot, ideally at staggered heights; this insures that as the dracaena matures, it  looks full and lush. Dracaena plants are considered slightly toxic, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A dracaena massangeana, also called a dracaena corn plant, can tolerate low light but grows faster and produces larger leaves in medium to bright indirect light. Unlike the low-light dracaena janet craig with its dark green leaves, the corn plant dracaena requires better light to maintain the pale yellow center stripe in the leaves.
Like all dracaenas, allow the top 50-75% of the soil to dry out before watering. A corn plant dracaena survives under-watering, but quickly dies from over-watering. If your water contains fluoride or chlorine, allow it to sit out over-night before using it so the chemicals can dissipate. High concentrations of fluoride damage the leaves and cause brown leaf tips. Never use water that has passed through a softener; it is too salty and causes leaf damage.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never feed a dracaena during the winter and fertilize only once during the fall.
Corn plant dracaenas do well in temperatures between 65°-80°F (18°-26.5°C).
These plants prefer high humidity, but still grow well in regular household humidity.
A corn plant dracaena may develop large, heavily scented flowers. I recommend cutting the flowers off as soon as they appear. As long as the flowers remain, new leaves do not develop and the elegant shape of the plant is altered. The flowers also drip messy sap on floors and furniture.
Mealy bugs and spider mites can be a problem. Keeping the large leaves clean and dust free helps prevent insect infestations.
Fusarium leaf spot and root rot due to over-watering are the main problems.
Use a loose, fast-draining, well-aerated soil. A dracaena can even be grown in lava rock mixed with soil.
All varieties of dracaena plants like to be root-bound in small pots. When the roots have filled the existing pot, move your dracaena to the NEXT size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape.
Trim the leaves with a clean, wet scissors. Using a wet scissors prevents unsightly yellowing in the cut areas.
Propagate by stem cuttings or air layering. You can read about both of these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
NASA lists dracaenas as plants that can clean the air of harmful chemicals such as benzene, trichloroethylene, formaldehyde, and xylene.
Corn plant dracaenas are slightly poisonous with a #1 toxicity leval.
Corn plant dracaenas do not bloom easily or often. These are some of the conditions that need to be met and even then your dracaena may not flower. A dracaena corn plant plant needs to be mature, at least 5-7ft. tall, and situated in very bright (no direct sun) humid area. The flower has a strong scent that many find offensive and severely stresses the plant, so you may not want to encourage your plant to flower.
It sounds like your corn plant dracaena has been over- watered. Cut off the bent dracaena stalks below the rotten areas and don’t water until the soil has thoroughly dried out.
The new leaves gets muddy brown tips when the plant is being under-watered.
Yes, you can put a corn plant dracaena out side for the summer, but be sure to keep it out of the direct sun. It takes just a few minutes in the direct sun for the leaves to burn. Also, be sure to bring a dracaena inside before the temperatures go below 60°f (15.6° C). A dracaena massangeana is very sensitive to the cold.
Dracaena plants like to be root – bound and should never be re-potted until the roots fill the existing pot. Once the roots of your plant have filled the pot, move it to the next size container but nothing larger. Many times, if you don’t water deeply and only sprinkle water on the surface, the roots do not develop properly and the plant is not anchored well in the container. This causes the plant to tip over even though it has not out grown the pot it is in.
There are several reasons why a dracaena massangeana, corn plant dracaena, gets yellow and brown leaves: too much plant food, using water has passed through a softener and is too salty, using water that has too much fluorine and chlorine in it. This is a stalk plant so it is normal for a dracaena massangeana to lose bottom leaves as long as it is getting new leaves at the top."
96,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Caladium Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/caladium-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Caladium, or Elephant Ear plant, a member of the the Araceae family, is a tuberous, rooted perennial that originally came from South America. It is closely related to an Alocasia, whose common name is also Elephant Ear plant. All plants in the Araceae family, including the diffenbachia and philodendron, contain calcium oxalate crystals and are extremely poisonous. Caladium plants, whether indoors or outdoors, look beautiful from late spring until early fall and then die back and become dormant until early spring.
Caladiums are bulb plants grown for their large, paper-thin, arrow-shaped, colorful leaves that are often more spectacular than many flowers. The most popular indoor varieties are the “fancy-leafed” and “lance-leafed” types. The leaves, some as long as 24 inches, have marbled, spotted, or veined patterns in red, pink, white, and green.

A caladium needs high humidity to keep leaves from curling and turning brown
Warm temperatures above 70° (if possible) and never below 60° during the growing season
Likes to be watered with tea
A caladium will go dormant and look like it is dying in the early fall. Do not throw it out. Cut the foliage back to the soil line and put the plant in a dark, cool location for several months. Water every 4-6 weeks. Once the weather warms up and the days are longer, move your caladium back to its original bright location. The beautiful ornamental foliage makes the extra care required to grow and then re-grow a caladium plant each year well worth it. These vividly colored plants are poisonous and must be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that may be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A caladium plant requires very bright indirect light. Keep a caladium plant out of the direct sun to prevent leaf burn.
The soil of a caladium plant should be moist but never soggy during the growing season. As the leaves start to die in the early fall and the caladium plant goes into its resting/dormant period, gradually reduce the water to about once every 4-6 weeks.
Fertilize a caladium plant every two weeks when it is actively growing with a water-soluble plant food, high in nitrogen, diluted to at 1/2 the recommended strength. Always dilute the plant food you are giving a caladium plant or the salt in the fertilizer will burn the leaves.
A caladium plant likes warm temperatures between 70°-85°F (21.1°-29.4°C) with as little fluctuation in temperature as possible. During the five or so months when a caladium plant is dormant, the temperature should be cooler but never below 55°F (12.8°C).
The main reason a caladium plant gets brown or curling leaves, is lack of sufficient humidity. There are several ways to increase the humidity around your caladium plant. You can set the plant on a bed of wet gravel or pebbles. Be sure the caladium plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Place a small humidifier in the room near your caladium plant. Group several houseplants near each other to create a mini greenhouse effect which increases the humidity in the room.
The flowers on a caladium plant are inconspicuous. The leaves are the beautiful part of a caladium plant.
The colorful leaves of a caladium plants attract mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids. Gently wash off any pests you see on the delicate leaves with warm soapy water. If the problem persists, spray the caladium plant with Neem Oil.
The high humidity a caladium plant requires can encourage fungal diseases such as fusarium and pythium and bacterial diseases such as leaf spot. Providing good air circulation and keeping the leaves of a caladium plant dry, helps prevent diseases. Use Neem Oil or a commercial fungicide that can be mixed with the soil to treat these fungal and bacterial diseases.
A caladium plant likes a slightly acidic, fast-draining soil. Once a month water your caladium plant with leftover tea or a very dilute solution of water and vinegar.
Plant caladium plant tubers in a 4″-6″ pot that has drip holes in the bottom. Cover the tubers with 1″-2″ of soil.
Caladiums do best when propagated in the spring after the plant has had a 5-month “rest.” Digging up and dividing the calathea plant tubers, and planting the tubers in a small pot of loose soil, is the best propagation method.
Caladium plants, whether indoors or outdoors, look beautiful from late spring until early fall and then die back and become dormant until early spring. In the fall, when the caladium plant leaves die, move the plant to a dry, dark, cool location. Water sparingly every six weeks. A caladium plant must “rest” and be dormant for about 5 months each year before it starts to grow again.
A Caladium plant is a very poisonous plant with a #3 toxicity level.
You can store your caladium plant tubers (bulbs) in the garage as long as the temperature stays above 55°F (12.8°C).
The brown spots on your caladium plant are probably leaf burn from the sun. These plants love bright light, but never put them in direct sun.
There are several reasons why the tips and edges of caladium plant leaves turn brown. You may be feeding it too much. Always dilute the plant food to1/2 the recommended strength or the salt in the fertilizer will burn the leaves. A caladium plant requires very high humidity and the air in our homes is often very dry. Put your caladium plant on a tray filled with water and pebbles, but be sure the plant is sitting on pebbles and not in the water. You can also try placing a small humidifier near your caladium plant.
The new leaves on your caladium plant are coming in smaller and less colorful because the plant isn’t getting enough light. Move your caladium plant to an area where it will get very bright light, but no direct sun.
If your Caladium Plant Bulbs were stored in an area that was too hot or too cold, below 55°F (12.8°C) or above 85°F (29.4°C), the bulbs might have been damaged. You may not physically see the damage on the bulb, but it does effect how well and how quickly a caladium plant grows."
97,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Dracaena Reflexa,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-reflexa-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A dracaena reflexa, native to Madigascar, Mauritius, and other islands of the Indian Ocean, is another member of the huge dracaena family. The regular dracaena reflexa, or pleomele, has dark green leaves. The dracaena reflexa, Song of India, has yellow stripes on the leaves, while the dracaena reflexa, Song of Jamaica, has off white stripes on the leaves. All varieties have short, narrow, pointed leaves that are spirally arranged on the stem and tufted at the ends of branches. This is is a slow growing, easy-care plant that can be used as a table plant, bush, or short tree. Dracaena plants are considered to be slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A dracaena reflexa with solid dark green leaves does well in medium light. The Song of India and Song of Jamaica, with yellow and white stripes in their leaves, need bright indirect light. Direct sun burns the leaves of all varieties of dracaena reflexa.
Like all dracaenas, the reflexa likes to be kept on the dry side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. I always suggest keeping the plant a little root bound in a small pot so the soil can dry out quickly and the roots do not stay wet too long. When you do water, water well enough so that it comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Dracaenas are very sensitive to fluorine in the water. If you water has a lot of chemicals in it, allow the water to sit out for 24 hours before using it; alternatively you can use rain water or distilled water.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength.
Basic household temperatures between 65°-85° are ideal.
A reflexa prefers high humidity. Leaf tips may turn brown if the humidity is too low.
A dracaena reflexa attracts mealy bugs, spider mites, and scale. Read more about these pests in the Glossary.
Fusarium leaf spot is the main disease that infects dracaenas. It causes leaf spots that are initially water-soaked and form on young leaves that are are kept wet. As the spots become larger, they turn reddish-brown or tan and frequently have a yellow margin.
Always use a loose, quick-draining soil for any dracaena; this helps prevent over-watering and root rot. Add sand to your regular potting mixture if the soil doesn’t drain quickly enough.
Dracaenas like to be root-bound in small pots.
These plants love to be cut back.
You can use stem cuttings to propagate new plants.
All dracaenas help clean the air of harmful toxins.
A dracaena reflexa is considered non-toxic to humans but cases have been reported of cats suffering tremors after nibbling on a reflexa.
The Dracaena reflexa “Song of India” needs better light than the solid green variety. Try moving it closer to an east or west-facing window. The more variegation in the leaves of a plant, the more light it requires.
NASA has determined that a dracaena reflexa removes formaldehyde from the air.
Fertilizing it more will only cause brown leaf tips. A Dracaena Reflexa, unlike a Dracaena Warneki, stays pretty short indoors. It rarely gets taller than 4 or 5 ft. The interesting twisting stems and colorful leaves of a Reflexa more than make up for its short stature."
98,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/10,Cactus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/houseplant-cactus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A cactus plant is an excellent, easy care, indoor or outdoor plant that adapted to very hot, dry, desert areas. Most cacti are succulent plants which means they store water so they can withstand long periods of drought. The leaves of a cactus plant became spines, so it is only the thick, fleshy, stems of the plant store the water. A cactus plant has a waxy skin that also helps the plant retain water.  Cacti plants are photosynthetic which means they use sunshine to convert water and carbon dioxide into food. The spines of the plant protect it from birds and other animals and help keep the plant cool by preventing water from escaping. These spines grow out of areoles which are like the leaf nodes found on other plants
There are about 2000 varieties of cacti, and they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. About 50% of indoor cactus plants will  bloom is properly cared for. Many produce large, beautiful flowers that can be yellow, white, orange, pink, red, and even blue. Some get flowers that bloom only at night and last just one day while others have flowers that last for weeks. Indoors, a potted cactus plant needs to be three or four years old before it blooms, and flowers only develop on new growth. Keeping a cactus plant slightly rootbound helps it to flower.
    

The base of the cactus becomes soft and mushy when the soil is too wet; this usually occurs in the winter. Although the plant cannot be saved, you can use the healthy upper part for propagation.
Little or no new growth occurs when you don’t give the plant enough water during the warm summer months and give the plant too much water in the cold winter months.
Small, brown, hard, shells on the plant means it has a plant pest called scale. Read how to identify and treat scale in the Glossary of the website.
White, cottony, sticky residue on the leaves is a sign mealy bugs.  Read how to identify and treat mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Tips of the stems become soft and shriveled when the plant is over watered.
Average household warmth in the spring, summer, and fall, 10°-20° cooler in winter
Provide good air circulation but do not mist
Place a cactus plant in the sunniest spot in your house
Over watering, especially in winter, is the main reason a cactus plant dies
When repotting, use the next size pot and nothing larger; this helps the soil dry out quickly and prevents root rot.
The spines on a Cactus plant (plural cacti, cactuses) are sharp and dangerous. Though not poisonous, a painful puncture wound from a cactus plant can get infected and cause serious problems for quite some time. Kept cactus plants out of the reach of children, dogs, cats, and other pets. You can read more about common outdoor and indoor plants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A cactus plant likes as much bright, indirect light as you can provide. Introduce a cactus plant to direct, morning sunlight gradually to prevent sunburn. The ideal location for a small cactus plant is near a south-facing window.
A cactus plant requires more water in the spring, summer, and early fall when it is growing than in the winter. Allow the soil of a cactus plant to almost dry out before watering during the winter months. Over-watering is the main reason a cactus plant dies.
Fertilize a cactus plant monthly in the late spring and summer when it is is actively growing. Do not fertilize a cactus plant during the rest of the year. Use a fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in potassium diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength. Tomato plant food works well.
An indoor cactus plant likes temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C)
A cactus plant originated in the desert and does well in very low humidity.
After a 3 month resting period and under proper conditions, a cactus plant may bloom during the late fall and winter. Keeping the plant a little root bound helps it to flower. Proper care during the summer encourages new growth. Flowers develop only on the new growth.
A cactus plant is susceptible to mealy bugs, scale, spider mites, and aphids. Scale is usually found around the spines and can be scrapped off with a child’s toothbrush. Spray the Green Solution (recipe in the Glossary) to get rid of any other pests on a cactus plant. Even plants full of sharp spines get pests!
Over-watering a cactus plant leads to crown, stem, and root rot, and is the major reason a cactus plant dies.
Using a fast-draining, porous, sandy soil helps prevent over-watering a cactus plant. This is the best way to prevent root-rot. You can purchase a special cactus or succulent plant soil at a nursery or make your own.
A vertical cactus plant needs a pot that has a diameter 1/2 the height of the plant. A horizontal cactus plant needs a pot that has a diameter 2″ larger than width of the plant. If a cactus plant starts to topple, plant it in a deeper pot.
How to propagate a cactus: Use offsets or stem cuttings in the spring or summer. It is important to let small cuttings dry out for a few days and large cutting for a few weeks before planting them in a peat based soil. You can these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
A cactus plant needs less water, drier soil, and cooler temperatures during the winter when it is resting.
Although a cactus plant is not a poisonous plant, getting a puncture wound from one of the sharp spines is very unpleasant and could be dangerous if not properly being taken care of.
The reason you cactus plant dies, is because you are over watering. A cactus plant is a great indoor plant only if you are careful not to give it too much water! The soil of a cactus plant must be allowed to dry out before you water. In cool weather, a cactus plant can survive on a tablespoon of water per month.
Your cactus plant will love to go outside in warm weather. Be careful to introduce your cactus plant to direct sunlight very gradually or it will get an ugly sunburn. Bring your cactus plant inside before temperatures go below 55°F (12.8°C)
Propagating a cactus plant is quite simple. Break off a small piece from an area on the original cactus plant that’s not easily visible. Dip the cut end of the piece you removed into a small amount of Rooting Hormone. Plant the cactus plant cutting in a small pot of porous, fast-draining soil. A cactus plant is a very slow growing plant so it may take quite some time before you have a substantial new plant.
There are several ways to tell if a cactus plant needs water. When the soil in the pot is wet it holds together, when it’s dry it becomes powdery and falls apart. You can try sticking your finger into the cactus plant pot as far down as you can to test for moisture. You can also stick your finger into the drip holes on the bottom of the pot to check for the moisture around your cactus plant. The easiest way is to simply look at your cactus plant. If the cactus plant has become soft, supple, or even a little shriveled; it is definitely time to water.
A cactus plant, like a gardenia plant, needs temperature fluctuations in order to produce flowers; for a cactus plant, there should be at least a 20°-25° difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. Feed a cactus plant with a fertilizer low in nitrogen (since it encourages green growth) and high in potassium (since it encourages flowering). Putting a cactus plant outside in the summer encourages the plant to flower, but be careful to avoid direct sun."

Outdoors, the long vines of English ivy plants can be seen clinging to garden walls, fences, tree trunks, and the exterior of homes and buildings, growing 60-90 ft. high and using its aerial roots to cling to surfaces. Where there is no surface for the roots to cling to, an English Ivy plant becomes a ground cover. Indoors, an English Ivy plant can be easily pruned to the size and shape that best fits it location. For smaller areas, select a small-leafed, slow-growing English Ivy variety.
The English Ivy plant is a very popular indoor houseplant available in over a hundred different colors such as solid green, variegated green and white, variegated green and yellow and different leaf shapes which may be lobed and unlobed. Whether you want a plant to sit on a table, grow at the base of another plant, hang in a basket, drape down in a wall sconce, or be trained as an impressive topiary plant, there is an English Ivy plant for you. They are also excellent climbers when attached to a trellis, stake, or a bark or styrofoam pole.

Crispy leaves indicate over not under watering
Prune leaf tips to keep an English Ivy bushy. Use clippings for propagation.
New variegated leaves are all green-plant needs more light
Leaf edges and tips  are brown and dry- temperatures are too low, air too dry, spider mites
New leaves are small and stems are bare with large spaces between the leaves-too little light
The English Ivy plant is a very popular indoor plant, but not as easy to care for as some think. The hot, dry air in our heated homes during the winter causes leaf damage and encourages spider mites. Increase the humidity by clustering plants together to create a mini greenhouse affect; placing a small humidifier nearby, or setting the plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. NASA has determined that English Ivy plants are excellent clean air plants and can absorb air-born toxins such as formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and especially benzene. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants
English Ivy plants like bright indirect light. Direct sun burns their leaves. When the light is too low, the new leaves are smaller and further apart on the stem.
Most English Ivy plants die because they are over-watered. Allow the top 25-30% of the soil to dry out before watering. Crispy leaves indicate over-watering not under-watering.
Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize monthly in the fall and winter. Never feed an English Ivy if the temperature is extremely hot or cold, if the soil is very dry, or if the ivy plant is not producing new leaves.
English Ivy plants grow well in temperatures between 55°- 75°F (12.8°-23.9° C) during the daytime and about 10° cooler at night (45°-65°F/ 7.2°-12.8°C). They do grow better when the temperature is consistent.
Medium to high humidity helps maintain the appearance of the leaves.
English Ivy plants are susceptible to spider mites, scale, mealy bugs, aphids, and white flies. To help prevent plant pests, spray once a month with the “Green Solution” (recipe in the Glossary).
Watch out for fungal and bacterial Leaf Spot disease. Read more about Leaf Spot disease in the Glossary of the website. https://www.houseplant411.com/glossary/leaf-spot-plant-disease-identify-and-treat

It’s a member of the Asparagaceae family and is a relative of the spider plant (which it does not resemble in the least). A Cast Iron plant is sometimes referred to as an Iron plant or a Ballroom Plant.
This is a rather plain plant with long, lancet shaped, pointed, course textured, leathery leaves that emerge directly from the soil. The leaves are over a foot long and 5” wide. Every individual leaf on the plant is grown on it own stem. You can separate a stem and its roots from the plant and propagate a new plant. When a cast iron plant is grown outdoors, it sometimes produces inconsequential purple and white flowers around the base of the plant. When grown as an indoor houseplant, it very rarely blooms.
There are several different varieties of the cast iron plants:
Variegated (Aspedistra “Ippin” and Aspedistra “Okame”) have lancet shaped green leaves with cream – colored stripes.
“Starry Night” has semi-glossy green leaves decorated with white or yellow small dots.
“Lennon’s Song” has dark green, long, narrow, lancet shaped leaves with an irregular pale yellow central stripe.
“Asahi” has green leathery leaves that develop white tips as the plant matures.
“Akebono” has  2-3ft long leaves with a cream or pale yellow stripe running down the center of each leaf.
The leaves on all of varieties revert back to solid green when the plant is in very low light.
                           
A. Variegated       A. Variegated         A. Starry Night                   A. Asahi
A Cast Iron plant is perfect for someone with a brown thumb or if you want to put a plant in an area where no other plant can possibly survive. They forgive you if you forget to water but develop root rot is you water too much. They can survive in low light, but the leaves get bleached if the light is too strong. This is the type of green friend that can only be “killed with kindness.
How much light for a cast iron plant: A cast iron plant grows in any low-light to bright, filtered light area. When the light is too bright, the color in the leaves starts to fade and older leaves may turn brown.
How to water a cast iron plant: Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. The lower the light the less often a cast Iion plant needs to be watered. In very low light, this plant may need water only every 2-3 weeks. over watering is the main reason a cast iron plant dies.
How to fertilize a cast iron plant: Feed monthly with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize a cast iron plant only when it it actively growing.
What is the best temperature for a cast iron plant: A cast iron plant does well in temperatures between 50°F-75°F (10°C-23.9°C). This plant can even survive in temperatures as low as 45°F(7.2°C).
How much humidity for a cast iron plant: Regular household humidity is fine for a cast iron plant.
Does a cast iron plant flower: Although a cast iron plant is a member of the lily family, its flowers are very small and inconsequential. The flowers appear near the surface of the soil and are often hidden by the leaves. The purple/brown colored flowers are about an inch long and after they die, a dark red berry may appear. an indoor cast iron plant rarely flowers.
Cast iron plant pests: A cast Iron plant is susceptible to mealy bugs and spider mites. Because of the simple leaf structure, pests are easily treated. Read more about these pests and how to treat them the in the Glossary of the website.
Cast iron plant disease: Leaf Spot disease caused by fungal and bacterial infections can be a problem. Provide good air circulation and keep the leaves of a cast iron plant dry to prevent diseases. Read more about Leaf Spot disease and how to recognize and treat it in the Glossary of the website.
What kind of soil for a Cast Iron plant: Use a rich organic indoor potting soil such as an African Violet mix.
How to prune a cast iron plant: A iast Iron plant rarely needs to be pruned.
How to propagate a cast iron plant: A cast Iron plant is propagated by plant division. Read more about plant propagation techniques in the Glossary. Another unique way to propagate a cast iron plant, is to remove a leaf stem and its roots and plant it in a very small pot of African violet soil.
Is a cast iron plant poisonous: This is a non-poisonous plant and is not toxic to cats, dogs, or children.
Cast Iron plant lose their white stripe when the light is too low. If you want the leaves to regain their white stripe, you’ll have to move your plant to brighter light. The more color in the leaves, the more light a plant requires.
If you move your Cast Iron plant to a low-light and a cool area it will be fine for three weeks.
The stems of a Cast Iron plant are below the soil. The leaves only look like they don’t have stems."

Today it is often planted in parks and outside large commercial buildings, quickly growing into impressive an tree. In recent years, a ficus benjamina has become an extremely popular indoor plant, replacing the Rubber tree as the most frequently purchased ficus variety.
For many years, a Ficus benjamina had the reputation of being a temperamental, high-light plant that easily dropped leaves if you just looked at it.  Today, however, there are new, hardy varieties that grow in almost any location. You can find ficus trees small enough to sit on a table or as large as 12ft. tall. The slender, pale brown, woody trunks can be straight, braided or twisted into a spiral. The thin, arching branches are covered in hundreds of 1”-3.5” glossy, leathery, pointed., oval to elliptical shaped leaves. All parts of the plant contain a milky, slightly toxic, white sap that can be quite irritating if eaten or if it gets into an open cut.
The original Ficus benjamina has green leaves and any fluctuation in light, temperature, or water caused  hundreds of the leaves to fall off. Today we have several hybrids of the original plant that have different leaf colors, can adapt well to medium and even low light, can be moved around to different areas of your home, and are even tolerant of temperature fluctuations.
Ficus Midnight looks very much like a ficus benjy but has deep- green to blackish – green glossy leaves
Golden King has shiny oval leaves that start out yellow/green. As the plant matures, the leaves become green in the center with a wide band of yellow/gold around the edge.
Ficus “Monique has dark green, narrow leaves with wavy edges
Ficus Natasja is a small plant with dark green leaves and only grows about 2ft tall. It is often used to create a ficus bonsai. It is not as hardy as some of the other hybrids and often drops leaves

Green leaves fall off new leaf buds turn black: too much water, change in location or temperature
Bright yellow leaves drop off: usually occurs when the plant is under watered.
Dry shriveled leaves: often occurs in the winter when the air is very dry
Bright indirect light
Never allow the soil to totally dry out, but be careful not to over water, especially in winter
Fertilize in spring and summer
Provide warm temperatures and keep plant away from cold drafts
Avoid frequent repotting
A Ficus benjamina is a beautiful addition to your home especially if you are careful to choose one of the new, hardier hybrids. This is not the kind of plant, like a dracaena, that can be ignored or watered on an irregular schedule. Follow the detailed care tips below and you’ll enjoy your Ficus benjamina for many years. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Ficus trees, especially the Benjamina and Wintergreen varieties, need very bright indirect light. New varieties, called “Ficus of the Future”, can survive in medium and even low light. Examples of “Ficus of the Future” are the Monique with ruffled green leaves, the Midnight with dark green/black leaves, and the ficus Alli with elongated leaves. Direct sun burns the leaves of all ficus trees.
Allow the top 25% of the soil to dry out before watering. Under-watering causes leaves to turn yellow. Green leaves to fall off and new growth turns black when a ficus is over-watered. Ficus trees grow better if you follow a consistent watering schedule.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer, when the tree is actively growing, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Indoor ficus trees like temperatures between 65°-85°F (18.3°-29.4°C). Keep a ficus tree away from cold drafts, air conditioners, and heaters or it will lose leaves.
Household humidity above 30% is best.
Ficus trees are susceptible to spider mites, scale, and mealy bugs. Spraying with the “Green Solution” (recipe in the Glossary) usually gets rid of most pests. Use a child’s toothbrush to scrape “scale” off the leaves and then spray with neem oil.
Anthranose and leaf spot are the two main houseplant diseases that affect ficus trees. They usually appear as yellow spots that turn brown and the leaves drop of. The best way to treat these diseases is to keep the leaves dry, spry with neem oil, or use a commercial fungicide.
Use a rich, quick-draining potting soil that contains sand, peat moss, and a little bark.
Ficus trees like to be a little root-bound in smaller containers. You can easily keep a 5′ ficus in a 10” pot. A pot that is too large encourages over-watering which leads to green leaves falling off.
The best time to prune is in the late summer or early fall after a ficus tree has stopped growing for the year. You can prune dead or broken branches at any time during the year.
Propagate an indoor ficus tree by stem cuttings or by air-layering. You can read more about these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
Ficus trees clean the air of formaldehyde and xylene.
A ficus is considered a slightly poisonous houseplant with a level #1 toxicity. Many people find the sap extremely irritating if it comes in contact with their skin.
A ficus tree gets yellow leaves when it is not getting enough water. Water a ficus until excess water drains out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Try to be consistent when watering.
The sticky stuff on the leaves of your ficus tree is called “honeydew” and it is left by the houseplant pest called scale. The “honeydew” attracts the black dust which is called black sooty mold. Locate the scale insects and scrape them off using a child’s toothbrush. Spray the entire tree with the “ green solution.” You can find out how to make the ” green solution” in the Glossary of the website.
The usual reason a ficus tree drops green leaves and new leaves turn black is over-watering. Leaves may also fall off due to changes in your watering schedule, amount of light, or changes in temperature. Cold drafts from doors or windows, and blasts of hot or cold air from heaters and air conditioners can also cause a ficus to lose leaves.
Ficus trees, especially the old benjamina varieties, lose leaves when moved to a new location. It may take up to two months for the plant to acclimate to its new home. I recommend using a product called superthrive when a ficus goes into “shock”. You can read about superthrive in the Glossary of the website. Don’t fertilize your new ficus until you start to see new growth.
I’m a big advocate of aggressively pruning a ficus tree. Pruning plants encourages new growth, controls the size and shape of the plant, and allows more light to reach the leaves. Start pruning a ficus tree in the center of the tree. Ficus trees need a great deal of light, so often the small branches at the center are very weak or have totally died and need to be removed. The outer part of the tree is called the canopy. You can remove up to 1/3 of the canopy without harming a ficus tree. By reducing the size of the canopy you’ll be helping the plant produce new healthy growth and become fuller. Always wear gloves when pruning. The sap from a ficus tree can be quite irritating if it gets on your skin. Never rip the branches off, always use a sharp tool and make clean small cuts."
102,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,China Doll Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/china-doll-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A China Doll, Radermachera sinica, plant is a very fast growing plant with lacy-looking, glossy, green foliage that is native to the subtropical mountain regions of southern China and Taiwan. China Doll plants appear very compact and sturdy when you first buy them because of the growth regulators given to them by growers. These growth regulators make normal sized leaves grow on short stems. As this regulator in the soil is used up, a China Doll plant starts growing in all directions just like the outdoor plant it really is. Instead of a dense plant with lots of leaves, it soon becomes open and feathery. To keep the plant thick, full, and bushy, prune frequently. A China Doll plant, with its soft delicate leaves, makes a beautiful houseplant if placed in very bright light and frequently pinched back.
A China Doll Plant requires very bright light.
China Doll plants want to be kept on the dry side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. The foliage may even turn a pale green when a China Doll plant needs water. Water around the entire soil surface so water reaches all of the roots.
Feed a China Doll plant monthly in the spring and summer when it is actively growing and every other month in the fall and winter with a balanced fertilizer at 1/2 the recommended strength.
A China Doll Plant does well in temperatures between 65°-75°F (18°-24°C). Keep China Doll Plants away from drafts and cold windowsills or the leaves fall off.
China Doll Plants grow well in basic household humidity.
A China Doll Plant gets flowers when grown as an outdoor plant, but not when grown indoors.
Spider Mites, aphids, and mealy bugs are attracted to China Doll plants. Because of its many leaves, it is difficult to get rid of houseplant pests on a China Doll plant. Check for insects every week as a precaution.
China Doll plants are prone to fungal infections that can cause the houseplant disease called Leaf Spot. Providing good air circulation and keeping the leaves dry helps prevent Leaf Spot disease.
Use a rich well-aerated soil that drains quickly for a China Doll plant. Add sand or perlite to loosen the soil if necessary.
Keep a China Doll plant well-pruned at all times, otherwise the plant becomes leggy, thin, and unsightly. When pruning a China Doll plant, always allow a few leaves to remain on each stem to produce food for the roots.
China Doll houseplants are propagated using stem cuttings.
A China Doll plant is a non-poisonous houseplant.
Your China Doll plant probably got too dry and that part of the plant is dead. You can’t save the stem and leaves once they become crisp. Cut that section off and new foliage will grow back.
The white sticky balls on your China Doll plant are Mealy Bugs. If there are just a few, dip a Q-tip in alcohol and wipe them off; for a large infestation spray the entire plant with the green solution (recipe in the Glossary). Repeat the spraying every 10 days for at least a month
Prune your China Doll plant back by at least 2/3’s and move it to a very bright location. Your plant shouldl grow back with stronger stems and lots of foliage.
China Doll plants lose green leaves when there is an abrupt change in watering, temperature, light, or if you repot it. Be sure the soil isn’t too wet.
You’ve over-watered your China doll Plant so much and so often that the roots have rotted. You can try cutting your plant all the way back and allowing the soil to thoroughly dry out. If there are any roots left they may put out some new growth. More realistically, your China Doll plant may be headed for the trashcan."
103,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Fiddle Leaf Fig Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/fiddle-leaf-fig-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Fiddle Leaf Fig, Ficus Lyrata, native to Australia, Melanesia, and Southern Asia, is easily recognized by its violin shaped leaves. It is a close relative of the popular Weeping Fig (Ficus Benjamina), the Rubber Tree plant (Ficus elastica), and is the same family as the Creeping Ficus (Ficus Pumila). All are part of the Ornamental Fig family Moraceae. As an outdoor plant, growing in a tropical rainforest, it sometimes reaches a height of 40ft (12 cm) or more.
A Fiddle Leaf Fig has large, green, shiny, leathery leaves with a wavy margin. The heavily veined leaves can be 12″- 18″ ( 30cm – 45cm) long and 8″-12″ (20cm-30cm) wide,  and grow on upright, woody stems. When immature, the plant can be small enough to sit on a table plant, but eventually, with proper care, it becomes a tall, impressive indoor tree. This is a bold looking plant that makes an impression wherever you place it.
The most common fiddle leaf fig has solid green leaves, but there are several other varieties gaining in popularity
Ficus lyrata “Bambino” “Dwarf Fiddle Leaf Fig” is a smaller version of common fiddle leaf fig
Ficus lyrata “Variegata” leaves have the usual dark green centers but the leaf edges can be white, cream, yellow, or silver.
Ficus lyrata “Compacta” is shorter ( 5 feet tall) and has smaller leaves bunched closely together.
Leaves turn yellow – too much sun or spider mites
Brown Leaf Spots – overwatering, under watering, leaf spot disease, too much plant food
Leaf Drop- overwatering or not enough light
Long stems without leaves – not enough light
Bright light but no direct sun or leaves will burn
Average warmth above 55°
Allow soil to dry out somewhat and be careful not to over water
Like to be a little root bound so do not rush to repot
Prefers high humidity
This plant is considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  The sap of all ficus plants is very irritating so be sure to use gloves when pruning or propagating.
A Fiddle Leaf Fig requires bright, indirect light. In low light, new leaves are small and mature leaves may fall off. Turn frequently to keep a Ficus Lyrata from growing toward the light and becoming lop-sided. Too much bright light causes the leaves to fade.
A Fiddle Leaf Fig requires less water than other ficus trees. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out and the leaves to become soft and flexible before watering. Keep the leaves dry and water off of the large fiddle shaped leaves to prevent mold. Too much water and water on the leaves can also cause ugly brown spots on the leaves.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Too much fertilizer when the plant is not actively growing causes leaf tip burn.
Fiddle Leaf Fig trees do well in temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°- 26.7°C). Keep all types of ficus trees away from air conditioners, cold drafts, and heating vents. Intense cold or heat causes leaf drop.
This plant does well in normal household humidity through it prefers higher humidity.
The broad leaves of a Fiddle Leaf Fig attract mealy bugs, thrip, whitefly, spider mites, and aphids. Spray every other week with warm soapy water to discourage these pests. Spraying a Fiddle Leaf Fig also keeps the large leaves dust free and clean so they can absorb more light. Dry leaves after spraying to prevent bacterial infections..
Powdery Mildew, root rot, and leaf spot disease
Use a well-aerated potting soil that holds water but still drains quickly.
Fiddle Leaf Fig plants, like all ficus plants, like being root-bound in small pots.
If a Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus Lyrata) gets too tall, gently remove it from its pot and trim the roots. Trimming the roots limits how tall the plant grows. Root-trimming a ficus plant can be done every few years during winter and fall. Cutting the stems back in the early spring encourages a ficus tree to become bushier.
Propagate using air- layering and stem cuttings.
A Fiddle Leaf Fig is considered a poisonous houseplant with a level #1 toxicity. The sap of is especially irritating.
Leaves on a Fiddle Leaf ficus are smaller and further apart when the plant is not getting enough light. You may have to move your Fiddle Leaf Fif to different locations in your home as the seasons change so that it always has enough light.
Yes, you can move a Fiddle Leaf Fig outside for the summer as long as you keep it in the shade and transition it slowly when you decide to move it back inside your home. A Fiddle Leaf Fig , like other ficus trees, doesn’t do well when there are sudden changes in light or temperature.
Leaves fall off a Fiddle Leaf Fig tree when the plant is over-watered or the bottom leaves are not getting enough light. Sudden changes in temperature and light can also cause leaf drop.
The sap from a Fiddle Leaf Fig plant is a form of “latex.” It can irritate the skin and cause problems if ingested. If you are allergic to latex, always use rubber gloves when working with a Fiddle Leaf Fig.
Without seeing the brown spots on your Fiddle leaf Fig plant, there may be a few things that causing the problem. Over watering causes root rot and this can cause brown spots. If the humidity is high or the leaves are frequently wet, Leaf Spot Disease is a problem. If there is not enough light, you can get dry brown spots on the older growth. Remove the diseased leaves, try to keep water off of the healthy leaves, decrease your water, and increase the air circulation around the plant.
The leaves of a Ficus Lyrata, or as it’s commonly called a Fiddle Leaf Fig, usually turn yellow because of an insect infestation such as scale, spider mites, or Mealy Bugs. The plants pests suck the color from the leaves. If the Ficus Lyrata is getting too much sun the leaves may bleach out and take on a yellowish hue.
1. Overwatering is the most common cause of brown spots. If the roots stay wet and are not allowed to dry out a bit between waterings, brown spots develop (first on the older leaves). These leaves eventually drop off. The discoloration usually starts at the edges of the leaf. The cure for this problem is simple, cut back on your water. If your client is not sure how wet the soil is at the bottom of the pot, have her/him buy a water meter. 2. The brown spots may be the sign of a plant disease such as Leaf Spot Disease caused by a bacteria that has infected the plant. These spots are usually lighter in color and generally appear on the newer leaves. The leaves may turn yellow eventually fall off. As with all fungal and bacterial diseases, better air circulation, well-drained soil, dry leaves, bright indirect light, and less water help control bacterial diseases on plants. Never mist a plant if Leaf Spot Disease is suspected. You can use a commercial Fungicide or the homemade remedy of putting a tablespoon or two of baking soda and a teaspoon or two of mineral oil in a spray bottle of water. Shake the solution well and then spray all areas of the plant that are infected. Keep infected plants away from your other houseplants. 3. Under watering: Pale brown, dry looking spots that start at the edge of the leaf and leaves that become soft and start to curl up are a sign of under watering. In cases of severe under watering, you may have to set the plant in a deep saucer of water for 15 minutes so it can absorb the water through the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. 4. A Fiddle Leaf Fig will all get brown leaf edges when the humidity is very low, when it is getting too much fertilizer, and when there is too much salt in the water you are using. Never use water that has passed through a softener and always dilute your fertilizer to 1/2 the recommended strength to prevent brown edges on leaves."
104,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Ctenanthe Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/ctenanthe-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Ctenanthe plant, native to tropical Brazil, is a member of the Marantaceae family and is related to the Calathea and Prayer plant. These evergreen perennials are grown primarily for the beauty of their large, oval, colorfully, patterned  leaves. The three species which make good houseplants are C. lubbersiana, C. oppenheimiana, and C. burle-marxii. C. lubbersiana reaches a height of about 18 inches and has green and yellow patterned elliptical leaves with pale green undersides. C. oppenheimiana also called the ‘Never Never Plant, grows as tall as 3ft., produces lance shaped leaves that are dark green with silver bands, and has foliage with maroon undersides. The Tricolor variety of C.oppenheimiana is even more colorful. C. burle-marxii is a smaller more compact plant that has silver gray elliptical leaves with green stripes. These plants are considered mildly poisonous (although often listed as non-toxic)), and may cause allergic reactions. It should be kept away from pets and small children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. A Ctenanthe is not easy to care for and leaves are quickly damaged when the humidity is not high enough. This plant can be quite frustrating for a novice plant grower.




Ctenanthes like bright indirect light. If there is insufficient light, new leaves appear solid green rather than patterned with attractive colors. If there is too much light, the colors in the leaves fade.




Keep the soil evenly moist but never soggy. Ctenanthes do not like to dry out, and do not like cold or hard water.




Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer diluting the plant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. Fertilize every other month in the fall and winter. Never feed a Ctenanthe immediately after repotting, wait at least 6 weeks.




Ctenanthes like warm consistent temperatures and will not tolerate temperatures below 60°F (15°C).




High humidity is very important. If the air is dry, place your Ctenanthe on a pebble tray filled with water. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.




The white or yellow flowers are small and inconsequential in comparison to the beautiful leaves. The flowers have 3 sepals, 3 petals, and form a short funnel.




Spider mite and mealy bug are the pests to look out for.




Botrytis, a fungal disease, can occur because of the high humidity these plants require.




Use a good all purpose potting mix that drains well but still retains moisture.




Re-pot once a year or every other year depending upon how quickly the plant roots fill the container.




A Ctenanthe rarely needs pruning, just remove any dead growth.




Ctenanthe plants are easily propagated using the offsets that develop into bushy clumps around the base of the plant. When propagating, it is important to use the same type of soil as was used for the original plant. Stem cuttings is another propagation choice. Keep the new plants warm and the soil moist until established.




A Ctenanthe plant is slightly poisonous, although it is often listed as non-toxic. It may cause individual allergic reactions. The ASPCA states that it is not poisonous to dogs and cats.
Yellow leaves on a Ctenenathe Plant means you are allowing the soil to get too dry. The soil of a Ctenanthe Plant should be moist at all times.
When a Ctenanthe gets too much light, heat, or too little water, the leaves curl up to protect themselves. Move your Ctenanthe to a cooler less bright location and give it a little more water. The leaves should unfold almost immediately.
You’ve probably over watered the plant and it has developed root rot. Although Ctenanthes like to be moist, they don’t like soggy soil. During the cooler months they need less water.
Ctenanthes needs a great deal of humidity. Brown dry leaf tips are caused by dry air and not enough humidity. Place your plant on a wet pebble tray or set a small humidifier near it."
105,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Chinese Evergreen Plant – Amelia,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/chinese-evergreen-plant-amelia-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Chinese Evergreen plant is one of the easiest and best-looking houseplants to have in your home or office. Aglaonemas, the scientific name for a Chinese Evergreen, are a hardy hybrid from the aroid family and originally came from the subtropics of southeast Asia. Chinese Evergreen plants can be used as upright table plants or, as they get larger, bushy floor plants. All of the many Chinese Evergreen plant varieties have long shiny leathery leaves with unique patterns of green, gray, and cream. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. NASA lists the Chinese Evergreen as one of its top ten plants to clean the air of harmful toxins.
Chinese Evergreen plants are one of the few houseplants with light green and gray in the leaves that can grow in low light. The newer varieties that have bright red, pink, yellow, and orange in the leaves require medium to bright light. Never place a Chinese Evergreen in the direct sun.
Allow the top 25-30% of the soil to dry out before watering. When the soil stays too wet for a long period of time, the stalks rot and die. If the soil gets too dry or too wet, yellow leaves develop.
Chinese Evergreen houseplants do not need much fertilizer. Feed every other month with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength when the plant is actively growing.
Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) can damage the leaves of Chinese Evergreen houseplants. Keep these plants out of cold winter drafts and away from air conditioners.
Chinese Evergreen plants prefer regular household humidity or higher if possible.
If your Chinese Evergreen produces flowers, I recommend immediately cutting them off. The flowers are not very attractive and use energy that the plant needs to produce its beautiful leaves.
A Chinese Evergreen plant is susceptible to mealy bugs, scale, and aphids. The “Green Solution” (recipe in Glossary of the website), sprayed on the entire plant usually solves the problem.
In high humidity, the large leaves of a Chinese Evergreen plant may develop bacterial diseases such as leaf spot disease.
The best soil is a basic, well-aerated houseplant potting soil that drains quickly.
Keep a Chinese Evergreen plant in a small pot so the soil can dry out quickly and the roots are not constantly wet. This helps prevent root rot.
If a Chinese Evergreen plant becomes thin and leggy, prune the stems a few inches above the soil line. The plant will send out new growth at the bottom of the stem and along the length of the stem.
Chinese Evergreen plants are propagated using stem cuttings and plant division.
NASA lists the Chinese Evergreen as one of the top 10 best houseplants to clean the air of harmful toxins.
Chinese Evergreen plants are poisonous with a #2 toxicity level due to the calcium oxalate crystals in the plant. Adverse reactions after contact with the sap include: skin irritations, irritation of mouth, lips, throat, and tongue if the leaves are eaten.
I’d remove the flowers from a Chinese Evergreen plant as soon as they appear. The flowers are really nothing more than white spaths. These spaths hinder leaf development, are not very attractive, and produce berries that weaken the plant.
Propagating a Chinese Evergreen plant is very simple and is done by Stem Cuttings or plant division.
The stems of a Chinese Evergreen get soft and mushy when the plant is over-watered. The lower the light the less water a Chinese Evergreen needs. Move your plant to a brighter, warmer location until the soil dries out. Once you move your plant back to its original location, be sure to allow the top 25%-30% of the soil to dry out before watering.
To make a Chinese Evergreen plant look full and bushy, cut off the top half of some of the tall stems. Your plant should start sending out new growth fairly quickly.
The leaves of a Chinese Evergreen plant turn yellow when the plant is not getting enough water and also turn yellow when it is getting too much water. You may have to take your Chinese Evergreen Plant out of its pot and feel the bottom of the soil to see if you are over or under-watering.
The sticky “stuff” on the leaves of your Chinese Evergreen plant is called “honeydew.” A plant pest called Mealy Bugs excretes the honeydew. Mealy Bugs are small sucking insects that look like tiny pieces of cotton on the leaves and stems of the plant."
106,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Fishtail Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/fishtail-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"If you love indoor palm plants but are getting tired of the usual ones like the Bamboo Palm or Parlor Palm, it’s time to try a Fishtail Palm. This unusual looking palm, native to Indonesia, Asia, and the South Pacific, is a large plant that grows well in a bright room, and is a member of the Arecaceae (Palmae) family.
A Fishtail Palm has large, arching, fan-shaped fronds (leaves) with bipinate, smaller leaflets about 6″ long and 4″ wide.  The plant gets its name, Fishtail Palm, because the leaflets are jagged at the distal end and resemble the tail of a fish.  As a houseplant, when properly cared for, a Fishtail Palm can reach a height 4ft-8ft (1.2m-2.4m). There are several types of Fishtail Palms such as the Caryota gigas (Giant Fishtail Palm),  Clumping Fishtail palm, Toddy Fishtail Palm, that are too large to use indoors.
Although most Fishtail Palms have single trunks, Caryota mitis,  the most popular variety used as a houseplant, is a suckering type. It produces several stems, growing near the base of the main stem and has numerous, ragged- edged leaflets. Caryota urens variety (Wine Fishtail Palm) has fewer, more triangular shaped leaflets.
Leaf Tip burn – occurs when the plant is under watered, in the direct sun, or there are too many chemicals in the water
Bright, indirect light but no direct sun.
Keep the soil barely moist and never allow it to totally dry out
Fertilize spring, summer, and fall when plant actively growing
Warm temperatures and high humidity help the plant look better and grow faster
Spotted fronds and leaflets – try using a plant food with some magnesium and chelated iron
Propagate by plant division
A  Fishtail Palm produces poisonous red berries should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in  Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Fishtail Palms need very bright indirect light from an east or west-facing window. Avoid direct exposure to the sun.
Water well and then allow the top 25% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Never allow the soil to totally dry out or permit a Fishtail Palm to sit in excess water. Leaf edges turn brown if there are too many chemicals in the water or the plant is under watered.
Fertilize monthly, when it is actively growing, with a basic houseplant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. Never fertilize in the winter.
Fishtail Palms prefer temperatures between 75°-85°F (23.9°-29.4°C) during the day and 60°-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C) at night. Keep a Fishtail Palm out of cold drafts and away from air conditioners. Nighttime temperatures should never go below 45°F (7.2°C).
A Fishtail Palm thrives in high humidity. It does exceptionally well in spas and indoor pool areas.
Spider mites are the main problem. Spray a Fishtail Palm with a mild solution of warm soapy water a few times a month. This prevents and gets rid of spider mites. It also keep the fronds clean and free of dust.
Fishtail Palms grow best when planted in a fast-draining porous soil containing a large amount of organic matter.
The new growth on a Fishtail Palm comes from the end of the stalk only. If you cut the newest frond off below where it is attached to the main stem, there will be NO more new growth on the plant.
The best way to propagate a Fishtail Palm is by plant division.
This is an excellent clean air plant.
The red berries on Fishtail Palm contain calcium oxalate and are poisonous to cats, dogs, and small children.
I’ve never seen a small Fishtail Palm for sale commercially. Fishtail Palms are large plants and usually come in grower’s pots that are 10” or bigger. These plants grow about 6-8 inches a year. Fishtail Palms are really for big homes or businesses that have lots of room and lots of light.
There could be several reasons: too much fertilizer (this usually affects the bottom leaves first), too much fluoride in the water, too little humidity, or allowing the soil to totally dry out. You’ll have to check them out one by one.
I don’t think so. The temperature in the room probably got too cold for a Fishtail Palm and damaged the leaves.
Sorry to say, you cannot cut a palm back to reduce its height. The palm will never grow again. Give it to a friend with higher ceilings.
No, but you will cause the tips of the leaves to turn brown. If the leaves look faded, you may be giving your Fishtail Palm too much light; if the leaves look blotchy, the plant may have spider mites.
If you don’t cut the flowers off, the entire stem of the Fishtail Palm will die back. The fruit of a Fishtail Palm contains oxalic acid which can burn your skin; so put on some plastic gloves when you remove the fruit."
107,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Bamboo Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bamboo-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Bamboo Palm is part of the larger Chamaedorea genus of about 105 species of palms. Chamaedorea palms are native to the tropical and subtropical parts of Mexico and Central America. Compared to other palms growing in the forest, they are relatively small, reaching a height of only about 5ft-20ft (1.5m-6m). The name Chamaedoria is Greek for “on the ground” and it refers to the fact that the fruit on a Chamaedorea palm could be easily reached when it was ripe. The Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii ) is one of the most popular varieties used as an indoor plant.
It’s easy to see why a Bamboo Palm is used so often as an indoor plant. It is a beautiful, compact, easy care, tropical looking plant that grows well in medium light. It can even be happy in lower light if you are careful with your water. Even though it is called a Bamboo Palm, it is not a relative of the real bamboo, a type of grass that requires very bright light. Indoors the plant be as tall as 5 – 7ft. and as wide as  3 -5ft. with multiple, reed-like stems growing in clumps. It’s these reed like stems that gave the Bamboo Palm its nickname, the Reed Palm. There are about 10-15 fronds on each stem and each frond has 10-14 pinnate (feathery), dark green leaflets. The base of each stem is covered in a tan-colored fiber that resembles bamboo.
Too much salt or other chemicals in your water or too much plant food causes brown leaf tips
Green leaves drop off when plant is over watered
Do not rush to repot; Bamboo Palms like to be root bound.
Avoid temperatures below 50°F (10°C)
Be sure soil is moist when fertilizing
Commercial insecticides harm the leaves; use an insecticidal soap for pest problems
The  graceful Bamboo palm is much hardier than an Areca palm and much less expensive than a Kentia palm.  Although NASA lists it as an excellent clean air plant, a Bamboo Palm is a slightly poisonous plant and should be kept away from small children. It is also toxic to cats, dogs and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. 
Although a bamboo palm grows faster in bright indirect light, it still does well in medium light, and grows very slowly in low light if you’re careful not to over-water.
Allow the top 1/3 of the soil of a bamboo palm to dry out before watering. These plants like barely moist but never soggy soil. Never allow a bamboo palm to sit in the excess water that drains from the pot. Do not use water that has passed through a softener because the high salt content damages the leaves. Leaf tips look pale in color and green leaves fall off when a bamboo palm is over-watered. New growth and leaf tips turn brown when a bamboo palm is under-watered. The confusing thing is that yellow leaves can develop when the plant is over or under- watered, so you need to check the soil as far down as you can to know if the plant needs water.
Feed a bamboo palm monthly in the spring and summer with a fertilizer high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not fertilize a bamboo palm if it is not actively growing or if the soil is very dry.
A bamboo palm does well in temperatures between 65°-80°F (18.3°-26.7°C).
All palms, including bamboo palms, like high humidity but still do well in basic household humidity.
Bamboo palms are very susceptible to spider mites, scale, and mealy bugs. Keep a bamboo palm clean by spraying it often with a mixture of biodegradable liquid soap and water. If the pests persist, spray the plant with an Insecticidal soap.
Root- rot due to over watering, sooty mold, fungal and viral infections such as rust can alb a problem.
Bamboo palms need a basic, well-aerated potting soil that drains quickly but still retains moisture.
Re-pot when the roots have filled the existing container. Always use the next size pot and nothing larger, be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can drain out.
Cut brown leaf tips with a wet scissors, and remove bare stalks. Clean your plant tools in alcohol after using them to prevent spreading plant diseases from plant to plant.
Bamboo palms are propagated from seeds. This is a very slow-growing plant and It usually takes 2-5 years for a bamboo palm to reach a decent size. I’d recommend leaving propagation to the professionals and buying an established plant.
NASA lists bamboo palms as excellent plants to clean the air of harmful chemicals.
Although the ASPCA lists a bamboo palm as a non-poisonous houseplant, other experts state that the entire plant, especially any berries that appear, is toxic. We’ve erred on the side of caution and have listed a Bamboo Palm as a poisonous houseplant with a #1 toxicity level.
The webbing on your bamboo palm is caused by spider mites. To eliminate spider mites, spray the entire plant with a mild, soapy water solution. If this doesn’t solve the spider mite problem, use a commercial insecticidal soap. You can read about insecticidal soap in theGlossary of the website.
Too much salt in the soil either from excess fertilizer or from chemicals in the water can cause brown leaf tips and brown lower leaves on a bamboo pam. Take your palm outside and flush out the soil 8-10 times with salt free, chemical free water. Never use water that has passed through a softener, it is too salty. If your household water contains a lot of chemicals allow it to sit out over night before using it.
Green leaves fall off of a bamboo palm because of over- watering.
You can help your Bamboo Palm grow faster by moving the plant to a location that gets bright indirect light and high humidity."
108,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Christmas Cactus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/christmas-cactus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Christmas Cactus plant, Schlumbergera bridgesii is one of the most popular flowering houseplants sold during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons. This cactus plant is totally different from the cactus we see growing in a hot, dry desert environment. A Christmas Cactus plant is a type of epiphyte in its native environment. Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, trees, and even rocks, in shady areas with high humidity.
There are three different varieties of holiday cactus plants that we often confuse with each other; they are the Thanksgiving Cactus (Schlumgera truncate), the Christmas Cactus (Schlumgera bridgesti, and the Easter Cactus (Rhipsalidopsis gaertnerrii). The easiest way to tell the difference between the three cactus plants is to look at the shape of their leaves. The leaves of a Thanksgiving Cactus have pointed tips on each side of its leaf segments. The Easter Cactus, which is not even related to the other two holiday cactus plants, has very rounded leaf edges. A Christmas Cactus has smooth leaves with scalloped edges. All three varieties have stems that look like small, thick, succulent, leaf-like pads that are attached to each other, and all produce colorful flowers around the holiday they are named for.
A Christmas Cactus, Thanksgiving Cactus, and an Easter Cactus are phototropic plants, also called “short day” or “long night” plants. They develop buds and flowers only when the days are short (less than 12 hours of light). A Christmas Cactus and a Thanksgiving Cactus require at least six weeks of short days and an Easter Cactus requires about 8-12 weeks of “short days.”. Chrysanthemums and poinsettias are also “short day” plants.
                               
Thanksgiving Cactus                 Easter Cactus                Purple Christmas Cactus     Christmas Cactus Flowers
A Christmas Cactus plant is an easy care, flowering plant that can live for 100 years, often passed on from generation to generation. Follow the care tips below and, with each passing year, watch your Christmas cactus get more beautiful.
How much light does a Christmas Cactus need: Place a Christmas cactus in bright indirect light but no direct sun. This plant can live in medium or low light, but flower buds may drop off or never form at all.
How to water a Christmas Cactus: Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. Buds fall off when the plant is over watered or severely under watered. Root rot is another problem caused by giving the plant too much water. Reduce the amount of water once a Christmas Cactus has finished flowering, and start watering again normally once it starts to produce new leaves.
How to fertilize a Christmas Cactus: Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer with a liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never feed a Christmas cactus after October 1st.
Best temperature for a Christmas Cactus: The right temperature is important if you want a Christmas cactus to produce flowers. To set the flower buds, the plant needs cool temperatures between 60°-65°F (16°-18°C) during the day and even cooler temperatures between 45°-55°F (7°-13°C) at night. Once buds have developed, provide warm temperatures between 70°F-75°F (21°C-24°C) during the day and 10° cooler temperatures at night. Cool temperatures help the flowers on a Christmas cactus to last longer.
Does a Christmas Cactus need high humidity: These plants grow well in normal household humidity.
Blooms develop when days are short and temperatures are low. Starting in early fall, place a Christmas cactus in total darkness 12 hours a day. Keeping a Christmas cactus plant in a cool area, 60°F-65°F (15.6°C-18.3°C) helps the flowers form by Christmas.
Christmas Cactus pests are mealy bugs and scale. When treating plant pest problems, avoid getting any sprays on the flowers.
Christmas cactus with necrotic spot virus get spotted, yellow or wilted leaves and stems. Over-watering causes bacterial root rot.
Use a rich acidic soil that drains well. Christmas Cactus love leftover tea.
Christmas cactus grow better and bloom more when they are slightly root-bound in smaller pots. If a Christmas cactus needs to be re-potted, usually only every few years, wait until it has finished flowering in the spring. Never re-pot a Christmas cactus when it is in bloom.
Pruning helps the plant become a full bushy and produce more blooms during the holiday season. The best time to prune a Christmas cactus is about a month after it has finished blooming. This brief rest encourages the Christmas Cactus to produce new growth and branch out. You should never prune a Christmas Cactus once summer has begun.
The best way to propagate a Christmas cactus is by using stem cuttings during the spring. Use a segment that has at least three segments, taken from a healthy stem. Allow the stem cuttings to dry out for a few hours before planting them to avoid stem rot.
Christmas cactus plants are perfect gifts for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Christmas cactus are not toxic to pets (dogs and cats) or children.
Buds drop off a Christmas Cactus without opening because of over-watering or severe under-watering, insufficient light, excessive heat, or the air is too dry.
There are several reasons why a Christmas Cactus doesn’t produce an abundance of flowers. The first is over-fertilization: stop feeding a Christmas Cactus in October if you want it to bloom for the holidays. Light & Temperature: a Christmas Cactus is a Photo and Thermo-tropic plant. Starting 8-10 weeks before the Holidays, Christmas Cactus Plants need 12-14 hours of complete darkness, cool temperatures at night, and bright light during the day. Proper light and temperature help set the buds on a Christmas Cactus Plant. Once the buds have formed, move your Christmas Cactus to an area that has bright indirect light.
After a Christmas Cactus has finished blooming, water less often so that the soil dries out more. Allow the Christmas Cactus to rest for a few weeks, and then cut off a few segments from each stem. Pruning a Christmas Cactus shortly after it has finished flowering helps the plant become bushy and full. The segments you cut off can be used to propagate new plants.
Use a good succulent plant potting soil for Christmas Cactus when it’s time to re-pot. Don’t be in a rush to move a Christmas Cactus to a larger container, they like being a little root-bound. The new container should be only one size larger than the current container and have drip holes in the bottom.
The best way to get dust off the leaves of a Christmas Cactus is to place the plant in the sink and gently spray it with warm water.
The best way to propagate a Christmas Cactus is by using stem tip cuttings in the spring."
109,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/11,Gardenia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/gardenia-plant/,,,"A Gardenia plant has beautiful, scented, waxy, white flowers and glossy, green leaves, but are very temperamental plants and won’t put up with neglect. A gardenia plant requires very specific growing conditions such as light, humidity, and temperature. Native to Japan and China,  these plants are usually seen as outdoor evergreen bushes on the southern and western coasts of the United States. The key to successfully growing a Gardenia plant indoors is to try to mimic the outdoor environment as closely as possible. Although it is quite a challenge and an accomplishment to grow a gardenia plant indoors, it is a flowering plant like none other. The jasmine fragrance of the flowers has inspired hundreds of perfumes. Before sending a gardenia plant as a gift, be sure the person you’re sending it to has the time to care for it and the proper environment, otherwise they will just be frustrated as the plant gradually dies.
A gardenia plant requires very bright light for at least 6-8 hours a day. Be prepared to move your gardenia to different locations as the seasons change. Grow lights may be necessary if there is not enough natural light to help your gardenia plant thrive.
Gardenia plants need to be watered very carefully. Allow the top 2-3 inches of the soil to dry out before watering. Over-watering causes root rot, brown spots on leaves, and buds not to open. Under-watering a gardenia plant results in green leaves falling off.
Fertilize every two weeks when a gardenia plant is actively growing in the spring and summer. Gardenia plants like a plant food that is made for acid loving plants. Always dilute the fertilizer to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed monthly in the fall and winter.
The correct temperature is extremely important. Ideal temperatures for gardenia plants are between 65°-70°F (18.3°-21.2°C) during the day and 55°-65°F (12.8°-18.3°C) at night. Cool night temperatures are essential for the buds to set. Gardenia buds drop off if temperatures go above 70°F (21.1°C).
High humidity is another gardenia plant requirement. Increase household humidity, especially during dry winter months, by placing a humidifier near the plant, putting a gardenia on a pebble tray filled with water (be sure the plant sits on the pebbles not in the water), or grouping several plants together. Misting doesn’t help increase the humidity for a gardenia plant and causes fungal growth on the leaves.
Gardenia plants will not bloom unless all of their light, water, fertilizer, and soil requirements are met. On top of that, in order for gardenia buds to set, the nighttime temperatures should be around 55°F (12.8°C).
Gardenia plants attract mealy bugs, spider mites, white flies, thrips, and aphids. If using a commercial insecticide or the Green Solution (recipe in Glossary), avoid spraying the buds or flowers.
The high humidity a garden plant needs encourages fungal and bacterial diseases. Prevent these diseases from ruining your plant by providing good air circulation, keeping the leaves dry, and temperatures cool.
Grows best in a well-drained acidic soil with some peat moss added. You can increase the acidity level in the soil and make your gardenia plants happy, by watering once a month with left-over tea or very dilute vinegar.
Pruning properly is very important if you want a gardenia plant to bloom. Since buds and flowers appear only on the new growth, old woody stems need to be removed to encourage the new young stems to develop.
Gardenia plants are propagated from stem cuttings. When you trim the plant in the spring and summer, save some of the 5″-6″ clippings to start new plants. You can read more about propagating a plant using stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Gardenias make a lovely gift for any occassion.
A gardenia is a non-poisonous houseplant.
Bud drop is a common problem with Gardenia Houseplants. There are several reasons why your Gardenia Plant is losing buds and leaves: lack of humidity, over or under watering, lack of light, and cold drafts. Start by increasing the light. If this doesn’t help stop the buds and leaves from falling off your gardenia plant, work your way through the other possible causes.
You should never touch the flowers on a Gardenia plant because it will cause brown blemishes. Look and smell, but do not touch the flowers! Gardenia plants like very bright light, but intense direct sun, magnified by the glass in a window, may burn the flowers.
The new leaves on your gardenia plant are smaller because the plant is not getting enough light or enough plant food.
There are several things you need to do in order to get a gardenia plant to flower. Prune old woody stems to encourage new growth. Put a gardenia plant in very bright light for most of the day. Temperatures need to be around 70°F (21.1°C) during the day and around 60°-65°F (15.6°-18.3°C) at night to set the buds.
Gardenia plants get usually get yellow leaves when they are not properly fertilized. Feed a gardenia plant with a plant food specifically made for acid loving plants. You can also pour some tea or very dilute vinegar into the soil once a month to increase the acidity in the soil. Be careful not to over-water, soil that stays wet all of the time also causes yellow leaves."
110,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,DIEFFENBACHIA  PLANT,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dieffenbachia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A dieffenbachia is a tropical plant originally found growing in the West Indies, Mexico, all the way south to Argentina. A dieffenbachia plant, or “Dumb Cane” plant as it is sometimes called, is a member of the Araceae family and a relative of the Anthurium, Caladium, Calla Lily, and Monstera Deliciosa. All plants in the Araceae family contain calcium oxalate crystals and are very poisonous. The sap from these plants is a severe irritant. A dieffenbachia got its nickname “Dumb Cane plant” because the toxic effect of the oxalates can cause a temporary inability to speak.A dieffenbachia plant grows outdoors in moderate climates where the temperature stays above 60°F (15.6°C). The plant can survive in lower temperatures but does not grow well. Indoors, learning how to care for a dieffenbachia plant is relatively easy if you remember that the plant needs bright light, but no direct sun, barely moist soil, and fertilizer on a regular basis
A dieffenbachia plant has straight, thick stems and alternate, large, broad, pointed, oblong leaves. When placed in front of a window and never turned, the stems bend towards the light source.  An outdoor dieffenbachia plant can grow as tall as 8ft-10 ft. and have huge leaves 15”-20” long. Indoors the leaves of a dieffenbachia are usually about 3″- 6″ wide and 6″ or more in length. As the plant matures and gets larger, and if it is properly pruned, it becomes a spectacular, bushy, floor plant. Dieffenbachias are fast-growing houseplants that get top heavy as they grow taller. Repotting them into a deep, narrow, heavy pot helps solve the problem. Giving the plant a 1/4 turn every time you water keeps a dieffenbachia growing straight up.  The decorative patterns on the leaves can be cream, white, light, and dark green,  yellow, and even pink.
Some of the most popular dieffenbachia varieties are the Tropic Snow, Camille, Amoena, Maculata, Seguine, Compacta, and Maryanne. The dieffenbachia “Starbright” even has some pink variation in the leaves.
     
D. Camille                     D. Maculata carina        D. Marianne               D.  Starbright
Leaves have brown edges: Cold drafts and allowing the soil to dry out too
Leaves become pale: Direct sun or too much very bright indirect light
Bottom of the main stem becomes soft and mushy: Overwatering and cold temperatures
Lower leaves yellow and droopy: Cold drafts, temperatures below 50,°  lack of light
  
All parts of a dieffenbachia plant are extremely poisonous and the plant should be kept away from children, dogs, cats, and other pets. Aways wear long sleeves and gloves when pruning or repotting. Clean your tools and swash your hands vigorously when finished caring for the plant.  Avoid putting your hands near your eyes and mouth when working with the plant. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant requires medium to bright, indirect light; but no direct sun. Direct sun burns the leaves and even too much bright light causes the vibrant leaf color to fade. When an indoor dieffenbachia does not get enough light, the new leaves are small and far apart on the stem.
How to water a dieffenbachia plant: Water well and then allow the top 2″-3″ of the soil to dry out before watering again. A dieffenbachia plant does best when watered on a regular schedule. If the soil gets too dry, the bottom leaves may turn yellow. If a dieffenbachia plant is over- watered, the plant stems get soft and mushy and the plant starts to die.
How to fertilize a dieffenbachia: Feed a dieffenbachia only when the plant is actively producing new leaves. Most dieffenbachia plants need to be fed every two weeks in the summer and once a month in the spring and fall. Never fertilize a dieffenbachia in the winter. Excess plant food causes browning around the edges of the leaves.
Best temperature for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant prefer temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C). The lower leaves on the plant turn yellow when exposed to cold drafts from doors, windows, or air conditioners.
How much humidity does a dieffenbachia plant need: High humidity is a plus for a dieffenbachia, but the plant still does well in basic household humidity.
Does a dieffenbachia plant flower: A dieffenbachia plant develops non-descript, spath-like flowers. Since the flowers slow leaf development, I recommend cutting the flowers off as soon as they appear.
Dieffenbachia plant pests: Spider mites and mealy bugs are two plant pests that can damage a dieffenbachia plant.Read more about bth of these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Dieffenbachia plant diseases: Since a dieffenbachia likes high humidity, it may get bacterial leaf spot, erwinia blight, and other bacterial diseases that often develop in humid conditions. Keep the leaves dry and provide good air circulation around the plant to prevent diseases.
Best soil for a dieffenbachia plant: The best soil for a dieffenbachia plant is a rich, organic mixture that drains quickly.
What size pot for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant likes to be a little root-bound. Repot t in the spring if the roots have filled the existing pot. The new dieffenbachia plant container should be only one size larger and must have drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a dieffenbachia plant: Aggressively prune a dieffenbachia plant to keep it bushy and to prevent the plant from getting top heavy. Always wear a long sleeve shirt and gloves when pruning; this prevents the toxic, irritating sap from getting on your skin. Never touch your eyes or mouth when pruning a dieffenbachia. Wash your tools thoroughly with some bleach when finished pruning.
How to propagate a dieffenbachia plant: The best way to propagate a dieffenbachia plant is by air layering if the stem is very thick, or by stem cuttings if the stems are thin. You can read more about these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
A dieffenbachia plant is extremely poisonous with a #4 toxicity level and very toxic to cats, dogs, and small children. If the sap from a dieffenbachia gets on your skin, wash it off immediately. Seek medical advice if a child or pet ingests any part of a dieffenbachia plant.
I know this will be hard, but the best way to keep a top-heavy dieffenbachia from falling over is to cut off the top 1/3-1/2 of the plant. The remaining dieffenbachia plant will send out new growth and quickly become sturdy and bushy. You can remove a few of the bottom leaves from the dieffenbachia section you cut off and use it to propagate a new plant. Always wear gloves when pruning!! Dieffenbachia sap is very toxic and can irritate the skin and inflame existing cuts or sores.
The bottom leaves on a dieffenbachia plant may turn yellow if the the plant is near a cold draft or an air conditioning vent; if the bottom of the dieffenbachia plant is not getting enough light; or if the dieffenbachia soil gotten too dry.
The edges of the leaves of a dieffenbachia plant usually turn brown from too much fertilizer or too much salt in water in the water you are using. Never use water that has passed through a water softener; it is much too salty for plants. Rinse the soil with distilled water several times to get rid of any unwanted chemicals.
It is normal for a dieffenbachia to lose its bottom leaves especially if it is not getting enough light. If your dieffenbachia plant is looking bare, cut off the top 1/3 of the plant stem. Cutting off the top of a dieffenbachia encourages the plant to send out new growth along the resining main stem and produce new stems from the roots."
111,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Begonia Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/begonia-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Begonia plant, part of the Begoniaceae  family, is often considered to be an outdoor plant, but they also make excellent indoor plants that can bloom the entire year. Begonia plants originally came from the tropical, moist regions of southern Asia, Africa, South America, and Central America which is why they require such high humidity to grow well. There are over 1500 varieties of begonia plants that fall into the categories of caned, rhizomatous, or tuberous. Each of these varieties have different care requirements but they all prefer warm temperatures, barely moist soil, bright, indirect light but no direct sun.
The leaves of some begonia plants, such as the Begonia Rex or the Iron Cross Begonia, have extraordinarily colorful foliage. Other varieties, such as the Rieger Begonia have broad green leaves and beautiful flowers. There are some such as the Angel Wing Begonia, that have both lovely flowers and outstanding leaves.
Rhizomatous Begonias have large, often colorful leaves that grow out of rhizomes, thick, fuzzy horizontal, stem-like growths that produces stems, roots and stores food for the plant.
               
 
A Cane Begonia is named for the tough, bamboo-like plant stems. The angel wing begonia is an example of a cane begonia.
          
B. Angel Wing    B. Dancing Girl         B. Looking Glass              B. Irian Java
 
A Tuberous Begonia develops from a from a tuber which is an enlarged stem. Like a rhizome, a tuber also stores food for the plant. A tuberous begonia produces beautiful flowers and sometimes blooms for up to three or four months.
       
 
Medium to bright indirect light, direct sun in the morning only
Allow soil to partially dry out before watering, keep water off the leaves, and reduce water in winter
Propagated easily by stem cuttings
Provide high humidity
Brighter the indirect light, the more flowers a begonia plant produces
A begonia plant is a slightly poisonous plant and toxic to dogs and cats.  Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Although certain varieties of begonia can adapt to lower light, most begonias need medium to bright indirect light. The better the light, the more flowers a begonia plant produces. Leaves and flowers drop off when the light is too low.
Water a begonia well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Too much water causes mildew, mold, and permanent root damage. Water dripped on the leaves may cause leaf-rot.
Feed a Begonia plant monthly with a fertilizer high in phosphorous at 1/2 the recommended strength.
Begonias plants do well in cool temperatures between 65°-75°.
A Begonia needs a great deal of humidity to thrive. You can increase the humidity by placing the plant on a wet pebble tray, by putting a small humidifier near the plant, or by grouping several plants close to each other and creating a mini- greenhouse effect.
The brighter the light, the more flowers a begonia produces.
Begonia plants are relatively pest-free.
Because of the high humidity begonia plants require, powdery mildew is a major problem. A commercial fungicide is usually the best way to get rid of powdery mildew on a begonia plant. To help prevent mildew and mold provide good air circulation and keep the leaves dry.
Begonia plants need a rich well-aerated soil that drains quickly. African Violet soil is a good choice.
Use a clay or terra cotta pot for a begonia; this helps the soil dry out quickly and prevents root-rot.
Immediately remove any dead leaves, stems, and flowers from a Begonia Plant to help prevent mold and mildew. Prune long stems to keep a Begonia Plant compact and full.
Begonia Plants are easily propagated from stem tip or leaf cuttings.
Begonias are poisonous plants with a #1 toxicity level. They are especially toxic to dogs and cats.
Massive leaf droppage on a Begonia Plant is usually caused by sudden changes in the environment or in the care of the plant; for example, temperatures that go from cold to hot, soil goes from very dry to very wet, light changes from very bright to very dark.
The white marks on the leaves of the Begonia Plant usually mean the plant is getting burned by too much sunlight. Some Begonia Plants can gradually be introduced to direct sun, but most Begonias prefer bright indirect light.
Begonias, like Peace Lilies, tend to bloom more often in bright light and when under a little stress. Move your Begonia Plant to brighter location, cut back on your fertilizer, and allow the soil dry out a bit more. This should encourage your Begonia Plant to produce more flowers.
The grey powder on the leaves of your Begonia Plant are an indication of the plant disease powdery mildew. Remove any diseased leaves on your Begonia Plant and any leaves that have dropped onto the soil, allow the soil to dry out more, keep the leaves dry, provide good air circulation, and spray your Begonia Plant with a commercial Fungicide."
112,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Dracaena Janet Craig,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-janet-craig-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Dracaena fragrans “Janet Craig,” previously known as a Dracaena deremensis “Janet Craig,” is native to tropical Africa; and in nature, can grow as tall as 49ft (15m). The slow growing, easy- care Dracaena janet craig is one of the most popular large houseplants used in homes and offices. It grows well in all light conditions, from low light to bright indirect light, and is very forgiving if you forget to water. This is a very forgiving plant that adapts to almost all growing conditions. Some other members of the Dracaena fragrans family include the Dracaena Warnekii, the Dracaena Corn Plant, the Dracaena Reflexa, the Dracaena Compacta, the Dracaena Sanderiana, and the Dracaena Lemon Lime
Dracaena janet craig plants have sword- shaped, leathery, shiny dark green leaves that can be as large as 3” (7.6cm) wide and 10”- 20” (25cm – 50.8cm) long. When small, a Dracaena janet craig looks good sitting on a table, desk, or counter; later, as the plant matures, it can be used as a stately floor plant, either in bush or tree form. When purchasing a large Dracaena janet craig, look for one that has at least 3-5 stalks at different heights; this helps ensure that the plant will stay bushy and full as it matures. If growing conditions are ideal, a Dracaena janet craig may produce tall, 10″-12″ (25.4cm- 30.48cm) stalks with large, heavily scented, white flowers. Although this is fun to see, the flowers produce a messy, sticky sap that gets on the floor, carpets, and nearby furniture. The flowers also slow down new leaf development and can even distort the attractive shape of the plant. I like to cut them off as soon as they start to appear.
Dracaena Janet Craig “Compacta” has thick green stems with several clumps of short, dark green, pointed leaves
Dracaena Janet Craig “Lisa” has narrow green leaves and is virtually indestructible; it is more expensive than the regular Dracaena janet craig.

Direct sun burns the leaves and causes ugly brown marks or bleached spots
Too much fertilizer or using fluorinated, chlorinated, or salty water causes leaf tip burn
Re-pot when the roots have filled the existing pot. These plants like to be snug in the pot.
A Dracaena janet craig is a stalk plant; bottom leaves turning yellow and dropping off is natural.
Over-watering is the main reason a Dracaena janet craig dies
A Dracaena janet craig is a tough plant that thrives on neglect, grows slowly even in low light, and forgives you if you forget to water. It’s the perfect plant for someone missing a “green thumb” or a novice to caring for houseplants.  Just remember not to kill the plant with kindness.
All dracaena plants, are slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous to dogs, cats, and small children in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A Dracaena janet craig will grow slowly in low light, but grows much faster in medium to bright indirect light. When the light is extremely low, new leaves are smaller and narrower. Placing a Dracaena janet craig in the direct sun for even a few minutes, burns the leaves.
When in doubt, do not water a Dracaena janet craig! Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. The lower the light, the less often a dracaena needs water. Fluoride, chlorine, or salt in the water causes brown leaf tips and yellow spots on the leaves.
Dracaena plants need very little fertilizer. Feed once or twice a year, in the spring and summer, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Too much plant food causes leaf tip burn.
A Dracaena janet craig prefers temperatures above 55°F (12.8°C). Cold winter drafts and blowing heaters damage the leaves.
Basic household humidity is sufficient.
If the growing conditions are right, a Dracaena janet craig may produce tall flower stalks with large, fragrant, white flowers. The flowers often slow down leaf production, ruin the shape of the plant, and secrete a messy, sticky sap that gets all over the plant, the floor,and furniture. I recommend cutting the flowers off as soon as they appear.
Mealy bugs and scale are the main plant pests that can be a problem. Spray with the non-toxic Green Solution (recipe in the Glossary) and then carefully wipe the leaves. This removes dust buildup as well as the plant pests.
Leaf Spot is the main plant disease problem. The attacking fungus or bacteria causes brown spots trimmed in yellow where it is feeding on the leaves. Read more about Leaf Spot disease and how to identify and treat it, in the Glossary of the website.
Use a loose soil that drains quickly for a Dracaena janet craig. In Hawaii, dracaenas are often grown and shipped to plant stores in lava rock. If you purchase a dracaena growing in lava rock, remove at least 1/3 of the rock and replace it with potting soil.
A Dracaena janet craig likes to be root bound so don’t rush to re-pot. Any new container should be only one size larger than the current pot and must have drip holes in the bottom.
A spindly or bare stemmed dracaena janet craig should be pruned during the spring and early summer. Cut off the top part of a cane anywhere along the stalk; new leaves develop directly below the cut. The pruned section can be used to start a new plant.
Dracaena janet craig cuttings do root in water. However, the preferred method is to use a 5″-8″ cane cutting. Note which end of the cutting is the top and which is the bottom so you can plant it in the right direction. Allow the cane cutting to sit out overnight so the cut end can dry out. Plant the cane cutting in a small pot of moist, very fine potting soil, and place the pot in indirect light. If, over time, the soil seems very dry, water slightly. In about 3-4 weeks the cuttings should root and new leaves begin to develop.
NASA lists a Dracaena janet craig as a clean air plant.
A Dracaena janet craig is sometimes listed as a non-poisonous houseplant; however, some pets, especially cats and dogs, have experienced problems after eating the leaves. My advice, keep all dracaenas away from your pets.
That’s a hard question to answer since it depends on the light in the room. A Dracaena Janet Craig plants grow very slowly in low light, but grow much faster in bright indirect light. Always allow some space between the ceiling and the plant for growth.
You can trim the leaves of your Dracaena Janet Craig using very sharp, wet, scissors. Using wet scissors helps prevent the cut edges of the plant leaves from turning yellow. Brown tips on Dracaenas usually indicate too much salt build-up in the soil due to over-fertilizing or too much fluoride or chlorine in your water. Dracaenas need very little plant food, feed only in the spring and summer not in the fall or winter. Never use water that has passed through a softener, it’s too salty.
If your Dracaena janet craig is too tall, cut the stalks back to whatever height you want. Think about the shape of the tree before you do any pruning because the plant will branch out, developing two or three new “heads” below each cut. You can dip the ends of the cane pieces you remove in a small amount of Rooting Hormone. Plant three or four of these stem pieces in potting soil to propagate a new plant.
Although the flowers on a Dracaena janet craig have a lovely fragrance, they present a couple of problems. The flower and its stalk often ruin the shape of the plant. As the Dracaena flower matures, it secretes a sticky, messy sap that gets on the plant leaves, floor, and anything else that’s nearby. I recommend removing Dracaena flowers sooner rather than later."
113,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Bird of Paradise Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bird-of-paradise-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Bird of Paradise plant (Strelitzia) is native to South Africa and part of the Strelitziaceae family.
There are five main types of Bird of Paradise plants; and, while some are perfect to grow as indoor houseplants, others, because of their size, should only be grown as landscape plants. Strelitzia alba (White Bird of Paradise), Strelitzia caudata (Mountain Strelitzia ), Strelitzia nicolai (White bird of paradise or giant bird of paradise; wild banana; blue-and-white strelitzia) are all extremely large plants sometimes growing as tall as 20 ft. The strelitzia juncea (African Desert Banana plant) is smaller, reaching a height of only 6 or 7 ft. When you visit a garden shop to purchase a Bird of Paradise to put inside your home, be care not to choose any of these!
The most popular Strelitzia species used as an indoor plant is the Strelitzia Reginae. It has very large, blue/green, oblong, leathery, paddle- shaped leaves that resemble those of a banana plant. Even indoors a Bird of Paradise plant with its upright, stiff leaves can easily reach a height of 4ft-6ft (1.2m-1.8m). After 4 or 5 years and the plant matures, it may, on rare occasions, produce spectacular, exotic- looking, orange, red and blue flowers called “crane flowers” (because they resemble the head of a crane). In warm climates, an outdoor Bird of Paradise plant often flowers throughout the year producing 25-30 flower spikes that can last for weeks.
Very bright light but no afternoon sun
Water from the bottom to prevent the soil from becoming compacted
Fertilize only in the spring and summer; too much plant food causes leaf tip
Repot immature plants every spring.
When rootbound, the large leaves do not open
If you have bright, warm spot in your home, with plenty of room for a large, impressive plant, a Bird of Paradise is an excellent choice. Keep the leaves clean and healthy by spraying them with a mild solution of warm soapy water. Never spray any product containing alcohol, any commercial leaf shine product, or any commercial insecticide, or fungicide on the leaves of a Bird of Paradise plant. They will ruin the finish on the leaves. A Bird of Paradise is a poisonous plant and is toxic to small children, cats, dogs, and other pets. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book  Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants
A Bird of Paradise plant requires very bright light. This plant can even be placed in the direct sun if you do it gradually and allow the leaves to slowly adapt. You may have to move a Bird of Paradise plant to different areas of your home as the seasons change in order to give it adequate light; placing it close to a south- facing window is always best. The leaves on a Bird of Paradise plant start to curl when it does not get enough light.
In the spring and summer keep the soil moist but never soggy. A Bird of Paradise plant needs less water in the fall and winter. Water from the bottom so the soil stays loose and remains well aerated. Water that has a high salt content burns the leaves.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when a Bird of Paradise is actively growing; use a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never fertilize a Bird of Paradise plant in the fall and winter when it is resting. Excess plant food deposits salts in the soil and these salts cause leaf tip burn.
An indoor Bird of Paradise plant grows best in temperatures between 65°-75°F (18.3°-23.9°C) during the spring, summer, and fall. In the winter, when the plant is “resting,” keep the temperature 10° cooler. Temperatures below 50°F (10.0°C) cause the leaves to curl and turn black.
A Bird of Paradise plant does well in basic household humidity.
Unlike the outdoor varieties, an indoor Bird of Paradise plant rarely blooms.
A Bird of Paradise is susceptible to scale, mealy bugs, and spider mites. Fortunately, these plant pests are quickly detected on the large broad leaves and easily wiped off with a soft cloth or warm soapy water. Alcohol, leaf shine, or any spray pesticide should never be used on the leaves; they harm the matte finish on the leaves.
The large leaves of a Bird of Paradise Plant are susceptible to a plant disease called Leaf Spot which can be caused by either a fungus or a bacteria. Remove infected leaves from the Bird of Paradise Plant quickly, clean out any leaf pieces in the soil, and avoid getting water on the leaves. If using a commercial fungicide, test it first on a small section of a leaf to be sure it won’t ruin its appearance.
Use a basic potting soil that retains water but drains well.
Check to see if the roots of the plant have filled the pot. If the plant is root bound, it may not be able to absorb enough water for the new leaves to unfold. When re-potting a Bird of Paradise, move to the next size pot and nothing larger, be sure there are drip holes in the bottom of the pot. A 3′-4′ Bird of Paradise plant is usually available in 10″ pots. A 5′-7′ Bird of Paradise comes in a 14″ pot.
Cut off any dead or damaged leaves and stems close to the soil.
The best way to propagate a Bird of Paradise plant is by plant division. You can read about the plant division techniques in the Glossary of the website.
A Bird of Paradise rests in the fall and winter and requires less water, no fertilizer, and cooler temperatures.
A Bird of Paradise plant has a #1 toxicity level.
A Bird of Paradise needs to be a mature plant, at least 4 or 5 years old, before it’s even capable of blooming. Once it reaches that age here a few ways to encourage it to bloom. Keep a Bird of Paradise plant root- bound and very crowded in its pot. Never re-pot a Bird of Paradise that is older than 4 or 5 years. Replace the upper 30% of the soil, leaving the top of the roots exposed. A Bird of Paradise plant needs a great deal of bright light in order to bloom, moving the plant outside for the summer helps. Use a fertilizer high in phosphorus during the summer to encourage flowers. In all honesty, indoor Bird of Paradise plants ever bloom.
Remove the dust and clean the leaves of a Bird of Paradise plant with a dilute solution of warm soapy water. Never use any leaf shine products they will mar the beautiful leaves.
The leaves of a Bird of Paradise plant curl when the plant is not getting enough light. Try moving your plant to a brighter location. If that doesn’t fix the problem, try giving the plant more water. If the leaves on your Bird of Paradise plant curl and also turn yellow or blotchy, check for spider mites."
114,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Dracaena Marginata,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-marginata-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A  Dracaena marginata is a member of the Dracaena family (Asparagaceae), and is often referred to by its common name, Madagascar Dragon Tree. The plant got its nickname because it is native to Madagascar and is related to the Dracaena Draco which means dragon dracaena. When small it can be used as a table plant, but it is especially impressive as a tall, specimen tree and can often be seem decorating large office buildings. A Dracaena marginata is often called a “False Palm” because its long, bare trunk and tufts of leaves at the very top give it a palm-like appearance.
A Dracaena marginata is a  stately plant with multiple, snake-like canes, and hundreds of long, thin, leaves. The canes are often thick, twisted, and woody, making them desirable very three very unique appearance. The original variety has narrow, arching, dark green leaves trimmed in deep red. The newer varieties have much more colorful leaves.
Dracaena Marginata Tri-Color has three colors in its long, slender leaves. A yellow stripe separates the green and red stripes.
Dracaena Marginata Colorama again has three colors in the leaves, but the red leaf edges are more prominent which gives the plant a red or deep pink appearance.
Dracaena Marginata Tri-Color Silver has long, thin silver colored leaves
Dracacaena Marginata Tarzan was found growing in Florida only ten years ago. The green leaves are thicker and wider than the usual marginata leaves.

All types of dracaena plants, the D. janet cragii, the D. massangeanna (corn plant dracaena), the dracaena lemon lime, the D. reflexa, and the D. compacta are easy-care, durable, indoor plants well suited for offices and homes. They are extremely tolerant of low light and little water. Dracaenas are stalk plants which means it is normal for them to lose their bottom leaves if they are getting new leaves at the top of the plant. NASA lists a Dracaena marginata as a plant that cleans the air of harmful chemicals. These plants really do thrive on neglect! Check out the tips below to see exactly how to care for a Dracaena Marginata.
Dracaena marginata plants prefer medium light, but survive in low light situations. Lower light slows down the growth rate and reduces the size of new leaves. Direct sun burns the leaves.
Over-watering causes root-rot and is the main reason a Dracaena marginata dies. Water well and don’t water again until the top 50% of the soil is dry. In low light, this could take up to three weeks. Brown tips on the leaves indicate over-watering or too much fluoride or salt in the water. Never use water that has passed through a softener, it is too salty. If your household water has a lot of chemicals, allow it to sit out overnight before using it or use rain water or distilled water. This is a stalk plant, so it is common for the lower leaves to turn yellow and fall off if the plant is getting new leaves at the top. Numerous yellow leaves means the plant needs more water.
Dracaenas are slow-growing plants that do not require a large amount of fertilizer. Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a water-soluble, well-balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not feed a dracaena in the fall or winter.
These plants prefer temperatures between 70°-80°F (21.1°- 26.7°C).
Basic household humidity is fine.
Dracaena marginata plants are very susceptible to spider mites, especially when temperatures are warm and the air is very dry. These pests are difficult to see until they have damaged the plant. Mealy bugs are another pest problem; they leave small, sticky, cottony deposits that are easy to see. You can read more about spider mites and mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Leaf spot disease and root-rot caused by over watering are the main disease problems.
Dracaena marginata plants grow well in a loose, quick-draining soil. These plants are from Hawaii and often arrive planted in lava rock. Remove 1/3 of the lava rock and replace it with a good potting mix.
Dracaena marginatas grow better when root-bound in small pots. Don’t be in a rush to re-pot any dracaena plant.
If the canes become bare at the bottom, cut the cane back to where you would like to encourage new growth. Several new stems eventually emerge below the cut and your marginata looks even more interesting.
I like to use stem cuttings rooted in water for propagation. You can use the canes you removed during the pruning process. Cut the stem piece you cut off into 12” sections. Mark which is the top and which is the bottom of each piece. Place the cuttings in a jar of water, bottom end in the water. Fill up the water as it is absorbed. Roots should start to develop at the bottom of each cutting within a few weeks. Leaves will develop along the stems. Once the stem sections are well rooted, you can plant them at the base of your original plant to make it look fuller or start new plants in small pots with drip holes in the bottom.
NASA lists a Dracaena marginata as an excellent plant for removing harmful chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.
A dracaena marginata is mildly poisonous to humans, but they are extremely toxic to dogs and cats with a #2 toxicity level.
Dracaena marginatas develop brown leaf tips when there are chemicals like fluoride, chlorine, and salt in the soil. Using water containing chemicals, over-fertilizing, and using water that has passed through a softener puts these chemicals into the soil and causes leaf burn. Brown tips also indicate that a Dracaena marginata may be over-watered.
Dracaena marginata are cane or stalk plants and it’s normal for them to get a few yellow leaves at the bottom as long as they are getting new leaves at the top. If the soil gets too dry, the plant will get numerous yellow leaves and you should give it more water.
Spider mites are usually the cause of pale, blotchy leaves on a Dracaena marginata plant. These plant pests are difficult to see but do leave a very fine reddish webbing on the plant and a gritty feel to the surface of the leaves. Spider mites suck the juices from the leaves of plants and cause leaf discoloration. Spray your plant with my ” green solution” every 10 days for a month to get rid of spider mites. (Recipe for making the green solution is in the Glossary of the website)
Mushy stems and canes on a Dracaena marginata are caused by over-watering which results in root-rot. Root-rot is the number one reason these plants die. Stop watering until the soil is almost dry. Remove all soft and mushy parts of the stems, and move your plant into bright indirect light."
115,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Bromeliad Plant- Guzmania,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/bromeliad-plant-guzmania/,,,"If you’re tired of buying expensive cut flower arrangements for your dining room table or the reception desk in your office, think about using an easy care Bromeliad plant. There are over 2500 species of bromeliads that are native to North, Central and South America. My favorites varieties of bromeliads are: neoregelia, aechmea, and guzmania. A Bromeliad guzmania plant has long, thin, green. leathery leaves. Brightly colored flowers, really bracts, that can be red, yellow, orange, or even deep purple grow from the center of the plant. You can use a single bromeliad plant or combine three different bromeliads to create your own special arrangement. A bromeliad plant only blooms once indoors, then it’s necessary to propagate a new plant using offsets from the original plant.
         
B. Marjan                       B. Rana                         B. Claret                              B. Sunshine                  B. Queen’s Tears
A bromeliad plant is very adaptable to all types of light, and there is a bromeliad plant variety for every light condition. If your bromeliad plant has thin green leaves it can survive in low light. If a bromeliad plant has thick gray leaves, it needs medium light. The flowers (colorful “bracts”) of a bromeliad plant fade quickly and the leaves turn pale green when it’s placed in very bright light. The leaves of a bromeliad plant get further apart and turn dark green when the plant needs more light.
Bromeliad plants are drought resistant succulents that like dry soil. A bromeliad plant has very small roots and over-watering is the number one reason bromeliad plants die. Some bromeliad plant varieties have “tanks” that like being filled with water; others varieties have fine hairs on their leaves that enjoy being misted.
Feed a bromeliad plant by spraying a liquid fertilizer directly onto the leaves a few times each season. Dilute the plant food 1/2 to 1/4 the recommended strength. Never put fertilizer into the central cup of a bromeliad plant.
Bromeliad plants are tropical plants that can survive in temperatures between 40F°-100°F (4.4C°-37.8°C) but prefer 70F°-75°F (21.1C- 23.9°C) during the day and ten degrees cooler at night. The blooms on a Bromeliad plant last longer when the temperature is cool.
A bromeliad plant grows well in basic household humidity.
Less intense light and cooler temperatures help the bromeliad plant flowers stay colorful longer. Indoors, a bromeliad plant blooms only once. As the bromeliad flower starts to die, the plant produces “pups,” baby plants, around the base of the mother plant. Cut off the dying flower, so the plant can direct its energy to helping the “pups” grow. You can use these “pups” to propagate a new bromeliad plant which will flower in about three years.
Scale and mealy bugs are a pest problem for bromeliads.
Fungal plant diseases such as Crown, Stem and Root Rot, Rust disease, and Leaf Spot disease can infect the Guzmania variety of bromeliads.
Use a light, well-aerated, fast-draining soil for a bromeliad plant. Add sand or perlite to the basic soil mix if the soil seems too heavy.
During the spring, as a bromeliad plant matures and outgrows its existing pot, move the plant to the next size container. After 3 or 4 years, when a bromeliad has reached maturity, it is usually in an 8’ pot. Bromeliad plants like to be root-bound in small pots so don’t rush to put them into a larger container.
A Bromeliad plant rarely needs to be pruned. If leaf tips turn brown, trim them with a sharp, wet scissors.
Once the bromeliad plant flowers die, small plants called “pups” or “offsets” grow around the base of the plant. When these offsets are several inches tall, dig them out, getting as many roots as possible, and plant the baby bromeliads in a 4” pot of loose soil. Be careful not to over-water the new plants while the roots are developing. A newly propagated bromeliad plant usually blooms in 1-3 years.
Bromeliads are non-poisonous houseplants.
The blooms (bracts) on bromeliad plant last longer when the plant is kept in a cool, low light area. The warmer and brighter the room, the more quickly the color in the bromeliad plant flowers fades.
I wouldn’t recommend leaving a bromeliad plant sitting in water. Keeping the roots constantly wet is a perfect way to kill a bromeliad plant. Water well before you leave and place the plant in a cool, low-light area. The bromeliad plant may dry out a bit, but will survive until you return.
I think that putting water in the center cup of a bromeliad plant encourages bacterial and fungus infections. Water a bromeliad plant sparingly around the roots. Avoid using water that has passed through a softener or is high in fluoride, chlorine, or salt for a bromeliad plant."
116,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Dracaena Corn Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-corn-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"The Dracaena fragrans ‘Massangeana’, or Dracaena Corn plant as it is usually called, is native to the tropical areas of Africa and a close relative of the Dracaena Warnekii (Striped Dracaena), Dracaena Janet Craig, Dracaena marginata, and Dracaena Compacta. It got its nickname “Corn Plant” dracaena, because the main, tall, unbranched stem of the plant resembles the main stalk of a corn plant. This slow growing, easy to care for plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. Although it’s hard to believe, because they look so different, some other members of this family include the Yucca and the Spider plant.
The tall, stately Dracaena Corn plant is a very popular houseplant, often growing taller than 6ft. (1.8 metres). Its long, green, graceful, lance shaped leaves have a one or two yellow or pale green stripes running down the center. The 1”-2” wide leaves grow in a spiral cluster at the top of a thick, central stem. Because of the plants appearance, it, and the Dracaena warnekii and marginata are often mistaken for a type of palm. A mature plant may produce large white flowers atop stalks that drape downwards. The very strong fragrance of the flowers is sometimes overwhelming, especially for people with allergies. Fortunately, the flowers only last about a week. Because of the sticky nectar and abundance of messy pollen the flowers produce, I always cut them off as soon as they appear.
D. fragrans “Tornada” has curled green leaves with a wide lime-coloured edge
 D. fragrans “Malakai” has dark green, light green, and white leaves
D. fragrans “Limelight” leaves are bright yellow/green at first, but, as the plants matures, the leaves turn a light lime-green.

Medium to bright, indirect light encourages larger leaves
When in doubt, do not water.
Fluoride in the water can damage the leaves
Never fertilize in the winter
Do not rush to repot; dracaenas like to be root-bound.
Dracaenas are stalk plants. It is natural for bottom leaves to die as new ones develop at the top of the plant.
A Dracaena Corn plant, like all dracaenas, is a very forgiving plant and is tolerant of lower light, missed waterings, and general neglect. Be careful not to kill it with kindness. When small, a Dracaena Corn plant can sit on a table, but its claim to fame is as an impressive 6ft-10ft tree. When purchasing this plant, be sure there are at least three canes in the pot, ideally at staggered heights; this insures that as the dracaena matures, it  looks full and lush. Dracaena plants are considered slightly toxic, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A dracaena massangeana, also called a dracaena corn plant, can tolerate low light but grows faster and produces larger leaves in medium to bright indirect light. Unlike the low-light dracaena janet craig with its dark green leaves, the corn plant dracaena requires better light to maintain the pale yellow center stripe in the leaves.
Like all dracaenas, allow the top 50-75% of the soil to dry out before watering. A corn plant dracaena survives under-watering, but quickly dies from over-watering. If your water contains fluoride or chlorine, allow it to sit out over-night before using it so the chemicals can dissipate. High concentrations of fluoride damage the leaves and cause brown leaf tips. Never use water that has passed through a softener; it is too salty and causes leaf damage.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never feed a dracaena during the winter and fertilize only once during the fall.
Corn plant dracaenas do well in temperatures between 65°-80°F (18°-26.5°C).
These plants prefer high humidity, but still grow well in regular household humidity.
A corn plant dracaena may develop large, heavily scented flowers. I recommend cutting the flowers off as soon as they appear. As long as the flowers remain, new leaves do not develop and the elegant shape of the plant is altered. The flowers also drip messy sap on floors and furniture.
Mealy bugs and spider mites can be a problem. Keeping the large leaves clean and dust free helps prevent insect infestations.
Fusarium leaf spot and root rot due to over-watering are the main problems.
Use a loose, fast-draining, well-aerated soil. A dracaena can even be grown in lava rock mixed with soil.
All varieties of dracaena plants like to be root-bound in small pots. When the roots have filled the existing pot, move your dracaena to the NEXT size pot and nothing larger. Be sure there are drip holes in the bottom so excess water can escape.
Trim the leaves with a clean, wet scissors. Using a wet scissors prevents unsightly yellowing in the cut areas.
Propagate by stem cuttings or air layering. You can read about both of these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
NASA lists dracaenas as plants that can clean the air of harmful chemicals such as benzene, trichloroethylene, formaldehyde, and xylene.
Corn plant dracaenas are slightly poisonous with a #1 toxicity leval.
Corn plant dracaenas do not bloom easily or often. These are some of the conditions that need to be met and even then your dracaena may not flower. A dracaena corn plant plant needs to be mature, at least 5-7ft. tall, and situated in very bright (no direct sun) humid area. The flower has a strong scent that many find offensive and severely stresses the plant, so you may not want to encourage your plant to flower.
It sounds like your corn plant dracaena has been over- watered. Cut off the bent dracaena stalks below the rotten areas and don’t water until the soil has thoroughly dried out.
The new leaves gets muddy brown tips when the plant is being under-watered.
Yes, you can put a corn plant dracaena out side for the summer, but be sure to keep it out of the direct sun. It takes just a few minutes in the direct sun for the leaves to burn. Also, be sure to bring a dracaena inside before the temperatures go below 60°f (15.6° C). A dracaena massangeana is very sensitive to the cold.
Dracaena plants like to be root – bound and should never be re-potted until the roots fill the existing pot. Once the roots of your plant have filled the pot, move it to the next size container but nothing larger. Many times, if you don’t water deeply and only sprinkle water on the surface, the roots do not develop properly and the plant is not anchored well in the container. This causes the plant to tip over even though it has not out grown the pot it is in.
There are several reasons why a dracaena massangeana, corn plant dracaena, gets yellow and brown leaves: too much plant food, using water has passed through a softener and is too salty, using water that has too much fluorine and chlorine in it. This is a stalk plant so it is normal for a dracaena massangeana to lose bottom leaves as long as it is getting new leaves at the top."
117,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Caladium Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/caladium-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Caladium, or Elephant Ear plant, a member of the the Araceae family, is a tuberous, rooted perennial that originally came from South America. It is closely related to an Alocasia, whose common name is also Elephant Ear plant. All plants in the Araceae family, including the diffenbachia and philodendron, contain calcium oxalate crystals and are extremely poisonous. Caladium plants, whether indoors or outdoors, look beautiful from late spring until early fall and then die back and become dormant until early spring.
Caladiums are bulb plants grown for their large, paper-thin, arrow-shaped, colorful leaves that are often more spectacular than many flowers. The most popular indoor varieties are the “fancy-leafed” and “lance-leafed” types. The leaves, some as long as 24 inches, have marbled, spotted, or veined patterns in red, pink, white, and green.
      
C. Spring Fling               C. Pearl Blush                 C. Autumn Beauty        C. Tapestry
A caladium needs high humidity to keep leaves from curling and turning brown
Warm temperatures above 70° (if possible) and never below 60° during the growing season
Likes to be watered with tea
A caladium will go dormant and look like it is dying in the early fall. Do not throw it out. Cut the foliage back to the soil line and put the plant in a dark, cool location for several months. Water every 4-6 weeks. Once the weather warms up and the days are longer, move your caladium back to its original bright location. The beautiful ornamental foliage makes the extra care required to grow and then re-grow a caladium plant each year well worth it. These vividly colored plants are poisonous and must be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that may be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A caladium plant requires very bright indirect light. Keep a caladium plant out of the direct sun to prevent leaf burn.
The soil of a caladium plant should be moist but never soggy during the growing season. As the leaves start to die in the early fall and the caladium plant goes into its resting/dormant period, gradually reduce the water to about once every 4-6 weeks.
Fertilize a caladium plant every two weeks when it is actively growing with a water-soluble plant food, high in nitrogen, diluted to at 1/2 the recommended strength. Always dilute the plant food you are giving a caladium plant or the salt in the fertilizer will burn the leaves.
A caladium plant likes warm temperatures between 70°-85°F (21.1°-29.4°C) with as little fluctuation in temperature as possible. During the five or so months when a caladium plant is dormant, the temperature should be cooler but never below 55°F (12.8°C).
The main reason a caladium plant gets brown or curling leaves, is lack of sufficient humidity. There are several ways to increase the humidity around your caladium plant. You can set the plant on a bed of wet gravel or pebbles. Be sure the caladium plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. Place a small humidifier in the room near your caladium plant. Group several houseplants near each other to create a mini greenhouse effect which increases the humidity in the room.
The flowers on a caladium plant are inconspicuous. The leaves are the beautiful part of a caladium plant.
The colorful leaves of a caladium plants attract mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids. Gently wash off any pests you see on the delicate leaves with warm soapy water. If the problem persists, spray the caladium plant with Neem Oil.
The high humidity a caladium plant requires can encourage fungal diseases such as fusarium and pythium and bacterial diseases such as leaf spot. Providing good air circulation and keeping the leaves of a caladium plant dry, helps prevent diseases. Use Neem Oil or a commercial fungicide that can be mixed with the soil to treat these fungal and bacterial diseases.
A caladium plant likes a slightly acidic, fast-draining soil. Once a month water your caladium plant with leftover tea or a very dilute solution of water and vinegar.
Plant caladium plant tubers in a 4″-6″ pot that has drip holes in the bottom. Cover the tubers with 1″-2″ of soil.
Caladiums do best when propagated in the spring after the plant has had a 5-month “rest.” Digging up and dividing the calathea plant tubers, and planting the tubers in a small pot of loose soil, is the best propagation method.
Caladium plants, whether indoors or outdoors, look beautiful from late spring until early fall and then die back and become dormant until early spring. In the fall, when the caladium plant leaves die, move the plant to a dry, dark, cool location. Water sparingly every six weeks. A caladium plant must “rest” and be dormant for about 5 months each year before it starts to grow again.
A Caladium plant is a very poisonous plant with a #3 toxicity level.
You can store your caladium plant tubers (bulbs) in the garage as long as the temperature stays above 55°F (12.8°C).
The brown spots on your caladium plant are probably leaf burn from the sun. These plants love bright light, but never put them in direct sun.
There are several reasons why the tips and edges of caladium plant leaves turn brown. You may be feeding it too much. Always dilute the plant food to1/2 the recommended strength or the salt in the fertilizer will burn the leaves. A caladium plant requires very high humidity and the air in our homes is often very dry. Put your caladium plant on a tray filled with water and pebbles, but be sure the plant is sitting on pebbles and not in the water. You can also try placing a small humidifier near your caladium plant.
The new leaves on your caladium plant are coming in smaller and less colorful because the plant isn’t getting enough light. Move your caladium plant to an area where it will get very bright light, but no direct sun.
If your Caladium Plant Bulbs were stored in an area that was too hot or too cold, below 55°F (12.8°C) or above 85°F (29.4°C), the bulbs might have been damaged. You may not physically see the damage on the bulb, but it does effect how well and how quickly a caladium plant grows."

The regular dracaena reflexa, or pleomele, has dark green leaves. The dracaena reflexa, Song of India, has yellow stripes on the leaves, while the dracaena reflexa, Song of Jamaica, has off white stripes on the leaves. All varieties have short, narrow, pointed leaves that are spirally arranged on the stem and tufted at the ends of branches. This is is a slow growing, easy-care plant that can be used as a table plant, bush, or short tree. Dracaena plants are considered to be slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A dracaena reflexa with solid dark green leaves does well in medium light. The Song of India and Song of Jamaica, with yellow and white stripes in their leaves, need bright indirect light. Direct sun burns the leaves of all varieties of dracaena reflexa.
Like all dracaenas, the reflexa likes to be kept on the dry side. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. I always suggest keeping the plant a little root bound in a small pot so the soil can dry out quickly and the roots do not stay wet too long. When you do water, water well enough so that it comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Dracaenas are very sensitive to fluorine in the water. If you water has a lot of chemicals in it, allow the water to sit out for 24 hours before using it; alternatively you can use rain water or distilled water.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength.
Basic household temperatures between 65°-85° are ideal.
A reflexa prefers high humidity. Leaf tips may turn brown if the humidity is too low.
A dracaena reflexa attracts mealy bugs, spider mites, and scale. Read more about these pests in the Glossary.
Fusarium leaf spot is the main disease that infects dracaenas. It causes leaf spots that are initially water-soaked and form on young leaves that are are kept wet. As the spots become larger, they turn reddish-brown or tan and frequently have a yellow margin.
Always use a loose, quick-draining soil for any dracaena; this helps prevent over-watering and root rot. Add sand to your regular potting mixture if the soil doesn’t drain quickly enough.
Dracaenas like to be root-bound in small pots.
These plants love to be cut back.
You can use stem cuttings to propagate new plants.
All dracaenas help clean the air of harmful toxins.
A dracaena reflexa is considered non-toxic to humans but cases have been reported of cats suffering tremors after nibbling on a reflexa.
The Dracaena reflexa “Song of India” needs better light than the solid green variety. Try moving it closer to an east or west-facing window. The more variegation in the leaves of a plant, the more light it requires.
NASA has determined that a dracaena reflexa removes formaldehyde from the air.
Fertilizing it more will only cause brown leaf tips. A Dracaena Reflexa, unlike a Dracaena Warneki, stays pretty short indoors. It rarely gets taller than 4 or 5 ft. The interesting twisting stems and colorful leaves of a Reflexa more than make up for its short stature."
119,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/12,Cactus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/houseplant-cactus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A cactus plant is an excellent, easy care, indoor or outdoor plant that adapted to very hot, dry, desert areas. Most cacti are succulent plants which means they store water so they can withstand long periods of drought. The leaves of a cactus plant became spines, so it is only the thick, fleshy, stems of the plant store the water. A cactus plant has a waxy skin that also helps the plant retain water.  Cacti plants are photosynthetic which means they use sunshine to convert water and carbon dioxide into food. The spines of the plant protect it from birds and other animals and help keep the plant cool by preventing water from escaping. These spines grow out of areoles which are like the leaf nodes found on other plants
There are about 2000 varieties of cacti, and they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. About 50% of indoor cactus plants will  bloom is properly cared for. Many produce large, beautiful flowers that can be yellow, white, orange, pink, red, and even blue. Some get flowers that bloom only at night and last just one day while others have flowers that last for weeks. Indoors, a potted cactus plant needs to be three or four years old before it blooms, and flowers only develop on new growth. Keeping a cactus plant slightly rootbound helps it to flower.
    

The base of the cactus becomes soft and mushy when the soil is too wet; this usually occurs in the winter. Although the plant cannot be saved, you can use the healthy upper part for propagation.
Little or no new growth occurs when you don’t give the plant enough water during the warm summer months and give the plant too much water in the cold winter months.
Small, brown, hard, shells on the plant means it has a plant pest called scale. Read how to identify and treat scale in the Glossary of the website.
White, cottony, sticky residue on the leaves is a sign mealy bugs.  Read how to identify and treat mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
Tips of the stems become soft and shriveled when the plant is over watered.
Average household warmth in the spring, summer, and fall, 10°-20° cooler in winter
Provide good air circulation but do not mist
Place a cactus plant in the sunniest spot in your house
Over watering, especially in winter, is the main reason a cactus plant dies
When repotting, use the next size pot and nothing larger; this helps the soil dry out quickly and prevents root rot.
The spines on a Cactus plant (plural cacti, cactuses) are sharp and dangerous. Though not poisonous, a painful puncture wound from a cactus plant can get infected and cause serious problems for quite some time. Kept cactus plants out of the reach of children, dogs, cats, and other pets. You can read more about common outdoor and indoor plants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A cactus plant likes as much bright, indirect light as you can provide. Introduce a cactus plant to direct, morning sunlight gradually to prevent sunburn. The ideal location for a small cactus plant is near a south-facing window.
A cactus plant requires more water in the spring, summer, and early fall when it is growing than in the winter. Allow the soil of a cactus plant to almost dry out before watering during the winter months. Over-watering is the main reason a cactus plant dies.
Fertilize a cactus plant monthly in the late spring and summer when it is is actively growing. Do not fertilize a cactus plant during the rest of the year. Use a fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in potassium diluted to 1/4 the recommended strength. Tomato plant food works well.
An indoor cactus plant likes temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C)
A cactus plant originated in the desert and does well in very low humidity.
After a 3 month resting period and under proper conditions, a cactus plant may bloom during the late fall and winter. Keeping the plant a little root bound helps it to flower. Proper care during the summer encourages new growth. Flowers develop only on the new growth.
A cactus plant is susceptible to mealy bugs, scale, spider mites, and aphids. Scale is usually found around the spines and can be scrapped off with a child’s toothbrush. Spray the Green Solution (recipe in the Glossary) to get rid of any other pests on a cactus plant. Even plants full of sharp spines get pests!
Over-watering a cactus plant leads to crown, stem, and root rot, and is the major reason a cactus plant dies.
Using a fast-draining, porous, sandy soil helps prevent over-watering a cactus plant. This is the best way to prevent root-rot. You can purchase a special cactus or succulent plant soil at a nursery or make your own.
A vertical cactus plant needs a pot that has a diameter 1/2 the height of the plant. A horizontal cactus plant needs a pot that has a diameter 2″ larger than width of the plant. If a cactus plant starts to topple, plant it in a deeper pot.
How to propagate a cactus: Use offsets or stem cuttings in the spring or summer. It is important to let small cuttings dry out for a few days and large cutting for a few weeks before planting them in a peat based soil. You can these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
A cactus plant needs less water, drier soil, and cooler temperatures during the winter when it is resting.
Although a cactus plant is not a poisonous plant, getting a puncture wound from one of the sharp spines is very unpleasant and could be dangerous if not properly being taken care of.
The reason you cactus plant dies, is because you are over watering. A cactus plant is a great indoor plant only if you are careful not to give it too much water! The soil of a cactus plant must be allowed to dry out before you water. In cool weather, a cactus plant can survive on a tablespoon of water per month.
Your cactus plant will love to go outside in warm weather. Be careful to introduce your cactus plant to direct sunlight very gradually or it will get an ugly sunburn. Bring your cactus plant inside before temperatures go below 55°F (12.8°C)
Propagating a cactus plant is quite simple. Break off a small piece from an area on the original cactus plant that’s not easily visible. Dip the cut end of the piece you removed into a small amount of Rooting Hormone. Plant the cactus plant cutting in a small pot of porous, fast-draining soil. A cactus plant is a very slow growing plant so it may take quite some time before you have a substantial new plant.
There are several ways to tell if a cactus plant needs water. When the soil in the pot is wet it holds together, when it’s dry it becomes powdery and falls apart. You can try sticking your finger into the cactus plant pot as far down as you can to test for moisture. You can also stick your finger into the drip holes on the bottom of the pot to check for the moisture around your cactus plant. The easiest way is to simply look at your cactus plant. If the cactus plant has become soft, supple, or even a little shriveled; it is definitely time to water.
A cactus plant, like a gardenia plant, needs temperature fluctuations in order to produce flowers; for a cactus plant, there should be at least a 20°-25° difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. Feed a cactus plant with a fertilizer low in nitrogen (since it encourages green growth) and high in potassium (since it encourages flowering). Putting a cactus plant outside in the summer encourages the plant to flower, but be careful to avoid direct sun."
120,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Coleus Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/coleus-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Coleus plant (Solenostemon scutellarioides) is a fast- growing plant in the Lamiaceae (Mint) family. These extremely versatile plants are native to southeast Asia and all the way south to Australia. Coleus plants were very popular during the Victorian era but fell out of favor for a while because of the poor plant quality being sold. Today a Coleus plant is once again very popular both as an indoor and as an outdoor plant.
The bold colors and patterns on the leaves can be a mixture of lavender, cream, pink, maroon, yellow, red, bronze, and various shades of green. The color patterns can be marbled, stripped, or dappled. The leaves range in size from 1 to 6 inches (2.5-15 cm) and are usually oval with serrated edges; though some like the Kiwi Fern Coleus have long, narrow frilly leaves.
There are a few secrets to successfully growing  a coleus as an indoor plant.
Bright light is the key if you want dramatic, vibrant leaf color, but avoid afternoon sun or the bright colors in the leaves quickly fade.
Coleus plants like to be warm, so keep the temperature above 55°f (12.8°C).
This is a thin- leafed plant so it needs to be watered more often than a succulent plant that stores water in its thick leaves; but be careful not to over water and cause root rot.
Aggressively prune if you want a coleus to stay full and bushy.
A coleus plant is easily propagated from the stem cuttings left over from pruning
Leggy stems – not enough light or stem tips need to be pinched more aggressively
Mushy, drooping stems when soil is damp – overwatering
Leaf Drop – Soil has gotten too dry
If you have a very bright area in your home that calls for a colorful plant, then a coleus is perfect. This inexpensive, fast growing plant can sit on a table or look beautiful in a hanging basket; and it is safe to have around small children, cats, dogs, and other pets.
A Coleus plant needs very bright, indirect light to grow well. These plants can even gradually acclimate to a few hours of direct sun. Fluorescent grow lights help make the leaf colors of a coleus plant even more spectacular.
A coleus plant is a fast- growing plant and the soil dries out more quickly than with many other indoor plants. Always allow the top few inches of soil to dry out before watering. Frequent wilting due to under-watering causes the leaves to develop crispy edges, dull colors, and brown spots. Over-watering is more serious and results in root rot.
The best fertilizer for a coleus plant is fish emulsion. If fish emulsion is not available, feed monthly with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
A coleus plant likes warm temperatures between 70°-85°F (21.1°-29.4°C) though it can survive in temperatures as low as 55°F (12°C).
High humidity is preferable, but a coleus still does well in homes and offices.
It’s recommended that you pinch off the small flowers as soon as they appear to encourage the beautiful leaves to grow.
Mealy bugs, aphids, and whitefly are plant pests attracted to a coleus. Check your plant weekly so these pests don’t get a foothold on too many leaves. Spraying a coleus plant with warm water helps keep insects away. Once infested, spray your coleus with the “Green Solution” (recipe in Glossary) and place yellow sticky insect cards on the soil to trap flying insects.
Because a coleus plant likes high humidity, powdery mildew can be a problem. Read how to identify and treat powdery mildew in the Glossary of the website.
Use a quick draining well-aerated potting soil. You can add some sand or perlite if the soil seems too heavy and dense.
A Coleus plant is a very fast growing plant. Check the roots every few months to see if the plant has out grown its container. When re-potting, always use the the next size pot and nothing larger; this prevents the soil from staying wet too long and causing root rot.
Aggressively prune the the leaf tips of a coleus plant to keep it looking bushy and prevent it from becoming leggy.
A coleus plant is easily propagated from stem cuttings. Read more about propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
Although a coleus plant is listed as a non-poisonous plant, it is not considered totally safe. I would err on the side of caution andkeep a coleus away from pets and small children.
There are several things you can do for your coleus plant if it is thin and leggy. Aggressively prune your plant; depending how bad the plant looks, you can even go as far down as the soil line. After pruning, move your coleus to a brighter location or place it under some florescent grow lights if you don’t have enough natural light.
A coleus plant droops when the soil is wet because the plant is over-watered and all or some of the roots have died. Take your coleus out of the pot and allow it to sit out over night bare rooted. Re-pot using new dry soil. Hopefully there are still a few roots left that will allow your Coleus plant to start growing again.
The colors in the leaves of your coleus are fading because the plant is getting too much direct sun light. Move your plant to an area that gets bright indirect or filtered light but no direct sun. The colors in the new leaves should be vibrant once again.
You can certainly move a coleus outside for the summer, just be careful that it’s not sitting in direct sunlight. Be sure to bring your coleus inside before temperatures go below 55°.
I recommend cutting the flowers off of a coleus plant as soon as they appear. The flowers slow down the growth of the beautiful, colorful leaves."
121,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Kentia Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/kentia-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Kenta Palm, Howea forsteriana, sometimes called a Paradise Palm, is native to Australia and Lord Howe Island in the South Pacific. It is a member of the Arecaceae palm group and a close relative of  the Neanthebella Palm, the Sentry Palm (Howea Belmoreana),  the Coconut Palm, and the Pygmy Date Palm. All these plants are  classified as “feather palms.” Outdoors a Kentia Palm is a very large plant that can stand 35-40ft tall and 5-10ft wide and produces white flowers atop long spikes. Fruit develops on mature plants that are more than 15 years old.
Even when grown indoors, this palm is a very large, impressive plant that requires plenty of space; it can be as tall as 10-12 feet and as wide as 4-5ft. The wide feathery fronds (leaves) can easily be 10”-14” long. While in nature, a kentia palm has a single stem, when purchased as an indoor plant, there are multiple stems since several kentia palms are usually planted together to help the plant appear full and bushy. The fact that this is a slow growing plant and there are several plants in the pot, helps explain why a kentia palm is so expensive to purchase.
Medium light
Over watering is the main reason a Kentia Palm dies
Provide warm temperature
Fertilize in spring and summer only
Use a sandy soil that drains quickly
Brown frond tips –
Over-fertilized, chemicals in the water, dry or cold air, needs more water
Gray, brittle fronds –
Palm is over watered
Brown spots on fronds – 
Leaf spot disease, extreme cold, direct sun, hard water
Pest Problems
Scale, mealy bugs, and spider mites
A Kentia Palm is one of the most elegant and expensive palms that can be used indoors. This is a slow growing plant that thrives in medium light; and even does well in low- light conditions if you are careful not to over water. Kentia Palms need plenty of room to grow, do not like dry air or bright sunshine, and prefer cool winter temperatures and warm, humid summers. A kentia Palm is nontoxic and safe to have around small children and pets.
A Kentia palm can survive in low light conditions, but grows better and develops more fronds in medium indirect light.
Water a Kentia palm well and then allow the top 25% of soil to dry out before watering again. Over-watering, resulting in root-rot, is the major reason Kentia palms die. Kentias, like most indoor palms, are sensitive to salt, fluoride, and chlorine in the water. Allow your water to sit out over night before using it or use distilled water if your household water has a high chemical concentration. Never use water that has passed through a softener, it is too salty.
A Kentia Palm is a slow growing plant and only needs to fertilized monthly in the spring and summer when it is actively growing. Use a balanced houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Keep the room temperature between 65 and 85 degrees for a Kentia Palm.
A Kentia Palm does well in basic household humidity.
Spider mites and mealy bugs are the main problems. Since palm fronds are easily damaged, never use any plant product that contains alcohol. Use a biodegradable soap solution to treat houseplant pests on palm plants; If this doesn’t eliminate the, try an Insecticidal Soap or Need Oil.
Use a well-aerated potting soil that drains quickly but still retains water; add sand if the soil appears heavy and claylike.
Kentia Palms are propagated by seeds. This is a difficult process best left to the experts.
A Kentia Palm is a non-poisonous plant.
 
Move your Kentia palm to better light to encourage more new growth.
Your doesn’t need more fertilizer, it needs more water. The brown tips on your palm are probably being caused by too much plant food.
Spotting on the top fronds of a kentia palm is usually the result of too much direct sun hitting the plant.
Kentia palms get brown /gray and crunchy fronds when they are over watered. Let the palm thoroughly dry out or you will lose it to root rot."

The schefflera plant originally came from Taiwan and, when grown as an outdoor plant, even flowers. These plants can be tall impressive trees, bushy floor plants, small table plants, or even be small enough to be used in a dish garden. A Hawaiian Schefflera is a bushy, upright houseplant with masses of small, shiny, leathery leaves. The original Hawaiian Schefflera has solid green leaves; the Hawaiian Schefflera “Gold Capella” has gold and green leaves; and the Hawaiian Schefflera “Tribute” has white and green leaves. All schefflera plants, also called arboricolas,  are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.  Hawaiian Schefflera plants are great table or floor plants for home or office, and they are also excellent plants if you want to try your hand at creating a bonsai plant.
The brighter the light the faster and fuller a Hawaiian Schefflera plant grows. Variegated Hawaiian Scheffleras like the “Capella” require more light than solid green Hawaiian scheffleras. Direct sun burns the leaves of all types of schefflera plants.
Water well and then allow the top 1/3 of the soil to dry out before watering again. This might be an inch or two in a small pot and 5″ or more in a large pot. Green leaves fall off and new growth turns black when a Hawaiian Schefflera is over- watered. Leaves turn bright yellow when it is under-watered.
Fertilize monthly in the spring and summer with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Avoid feeding schefflera plants when they are not actively growing.
Hawaiian Scheffleras are fine with basic household temperatures. Try to keep all Schefflera plants out of cold drafts and away from heaters and air conditioners.
Grow well in normal household humidity.
Hawaiian Schefflera plants flower in the wild but very rarely indoors.
Spider mite, scale, aphids, and mealy bugs can all be a problem especially on the new growth.
Bacterial diseases such as Leaf Blight and fungal diseases such as Leaf Spot may cause problems.
Use a well-aerated loose soil that retains water but still drains quickly.
Hawaiian Scheffleras prefer to be root-bound in small pots.
If a Hawaiian Schefflera gets too big or too thin and leggy, aggressively prune it back. Schefflera plants love to be pruned. New growth appears directly below the cut in the stem so try to make your cut above a stem leaf node.
Stem cuttings and air layering
Hawaiian Schefflera plants are mildly poisonous with a #1 toxicity Level.
The leaves on a Hawaiian Schefflera turn black and die and green leaves fall off when the plant is over-watered. You should also check to be sure there are no pests such as Mealy Bugs, Aphids, or spider mites feeding on the new growth.
Solid green Scheffleras do very well under those conditions, although the new leaves may be smaller and the plant a little less bushy than if it were in better light. The Capella variety needs more light to maintain the yellow coloring in the leaves.
The leaves of your Hawaiian Schefflera are losing their color and the webs on the plant are both caused by the plant pest spider mite. Spray with the “ green solution” every 10 days for at least a month.
Your Hawaiian Schefflera isn’t getting enough light to sustain the variegated leaves so the new leaves all come in green. Move your plant to a brighter location if you want it to produce yellow leaves again.
Scheffleras, both Hawaiian Scheffleras and Umbrella plant Scheffleras, develop yellow leaves when they do not get enough water."
123,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Cyclamen Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/cyclamen-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A cyclamen is a small, beautiful plant that flowers during the winter. This popular plant that grows well both indoors and outdoors, is native to North Africa, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin. Cyclamen plants are in the Primulaceae family, commonly known as the Primrose family, and are a relative of the Ardisia plant. The best variety to use as a houseplant is the Cyclamen “persicum” also called a Florist Cyclamen or “Persian Cyclamen.” To ensure that your new cyclamen blooms for several months, purchase the plant in September, October, or November, and select a plant that is full of buds. At home, place it in a cool, bright area away from the direct sun, and you’ll be able to enjoy the large, colorful flowers all winter.
A Cyclamen plant develops from underground tubers. A tuber is a brown, thickened, enlarged, underground part of the stem that stores plant nutrients. It produces the roots that anchor the plant; and stems, leaves, and flowers develop from growing points at the top of the tuber. Some tuberous plants, like the potato, are edible. Other popular tuberous houseplants are the caladium and the tuberous begonia. A cyclamen is a compact, table plant, growing only 8”-12” ( 20cm – 50cm) in height, that produces colorful,- butterfly-like flowers atop numerous tall, upright stems. The flower stems reach far above the foliage and each stem has only one flower. The 2” (5cm) flowers have five petals and come in red, white, pink, or lavender; some even have a pleasant, sweet scent. The distinctive leaves of a cyclamen are heart shaped and marked with a silver design. New cyclamen hybrids may have ruffled leaves or flowers.
Although Cyclamen Persecum is the most commonly sold,  there are several other hybrid varieties that have been developed over the years that make wonderful houseplants.
Persecum “Ruffled Cyclamen” has flowers, that come in many colors, with ruffled edges
Persecum “Wild Persian Cyclamen” has a lovely scent and are mini-sized plants.
Persecum “Albidum” has white flowers
Cyclamen “coum”  (Eastern Cyclamen) has dark green and silver leaves and produces . white, magenta, or pink flowers. Best indoor varieties are Silver Leaf White, Silver Leaf Light Pink, Silver Leaf Dark Pink
Cyclamen hederifolium ‘Ruby Glow’ has dark pink or crimson flowers and heart shaped green leaves with grey and white patterns.
        
Cool temperatures  50-60°F (10°-15.6°C)
Water from the bottomed and never get the crown of the plant wet
Bright, indirect light but no direct sun
Best propagated using seeds
Needs to go dormant and rest for at least two months
Cyclamen plants bloom in the winter, so they are popular gifts for Christmas and Valentine’s Day. Although some people discard their cyclamen plants once they finish flowering, I recommend keeping them. These little gems will grow and re-bloom as indoor houseplants for several years if you remember these tips.
After a cyclamen plant finishes flowering, it needs to rest (become dormant) from late spring to early fall. Leaves turn yellow and the looks like it is dying. During this time, place the plant in a dark, cool area, allow all the leaves to die, and do not water or fertilize. You can remove the dead leaves. As soon as new leaves start to appear, usually around August or September, return your plant to its original bright, cool location, and resume watering and feeding.
During the fall and winter, indoor cyclamen plants need bright, indirect light. When your cyclamen become dormant sometime in the spring, put it in a darker, cooler area until it starts to produce new leaves in the fall.
People who have problems with cyclamen plants usually make the mistake of watering them from the top rather than the bottom. Also, never water the very center of the plant. Allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering. When your Cyclamen starts to droop a little, place it in a deep saucer of water for about 10 minutes, filling the saucer as needed. Allow the excess water in the soil to drain before returning the plant to its decorative container. Cyclamen leaves do not like to be wet, so try to keep them dry at all times
Unlike most house plants, a cyclamen likes to be fed in the fall and winter. Feed monthly during these seasons when the plant is actively growing with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Indoors cylamen grow faster and bloom more often in cool temperatures between 55°-65°F (12.8°-18.3°C). When cyclamen plants are dormant, during the spring and summer, place them in an area where the temperature is never below 45°F (7.2°C) or above 60° F (15.5°C). Avoid placing them in drafts or in front of heaters.
Cyclamen prefer high humidity. If the air in your home is very dry, place your plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water. You can also place a small humidifier near the plant.
Remove dead flowers as soon as they appear. I’ve found that stressing a cyclamen by allowing it to droop a little before watering encourages it to bloom more often.
The main insects to look out for are spider mites. You can see a picture of spider mites and learn how to treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Cyclamen may develop gray mold and botrytis because of the high humidity they prefer. Never misting and keeping the leaves dry at all times helps prevent plant diseases. You can see what both of these diseases look like and how to treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Use a rich potting soil that drains well.
If your cyclamen has out-grown its container, re-pot during the summer when the plant is dormant. The new container should be no more than a few inches larger than the old one and have drip holes in the bottom..
Remove dead flowers and leaves as soon as they appear.
Propagate a cyclamen by dividing their plant tubers. Be sure each tuber has a “growing eye” and roots before planting them.
Indoor cyclamen plants need to rest from late spring to early fall in a dark, cool area. As soon as new leaves start to appear, usually around September, return your plant to its original bright location.
Cyclamen are perfect gifts for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Valentine’s Day since this is when they are usually in bloom.
Cyclamen are very poisonous plants with a #3 toxicity level. These plants contain saponins and all parts of the plant, especially the tubers and roots, can cause severe reactions if ingested. Cyclamen are especially harmful to dogs and cats.
Cyclamen plants get yellow leaves for several reasons. If the soil is dry and your cyclamen plant is drooping & turning yellow, it needs more water. If the soil is very wet and the leaves on your are turning yellow, you are giving the plant too much water and the roots are rotting. Always water a cyclamen from the bottom by sitting it in a deep saucer of water for 10 minutes.
Dead flowers and leaves on any plant should be removed as soon as they appear. Cyclamen plants prefer it if you gently pull off dead flowers and leaves rather than use a sharp scissors.
In order to flower, cyclamen must have a “rest” during the late spring and summer when many other plants just start to bloom. Cyclamen needs this rest to build up energy in its tubers to help the plant grow. In the fall, when new leaves appear, move your plant back to its bright location. It should be ready to grow and flower after this rest. Many indoor house plants like peace lilies, lipstick plants, and cyclamen flower more often when they are stressed a bit. Allow your plant to droop slightly before watering it from the bottom.
When it’s time for an indoor cyclamen plant to rest, move it to any low light, very cool area where the temperature is around 50-55°F. If you put your Cyclamen in the garage or the basement, be sure the area doesn’t get too hot or too cold."

A jade plant got the name “Money Plant” because, according the Feng Shui,  having it in your home, business, or office brings you prosperity and good luck. Do not confuse this plant with the Pachira Aquatica also called a Money plant or the Pilea peperomiodes (Chinese Money plant). Originally found in the dry hills of South Africa, it is very tolerant of all types of conditions except one – over watering.
A jade plant is a green friend that just won’t die! It got the name jade plant because of its resemblance to the jade gemstone. Today, there are many different varieties and cultivars available, with different leaf colors, patterns, and leaf shapes. The Crassula ovata remains the most the most popular. The scientific name is a perfect description of what the plant looks like. “Crassula” is latin for thick, and refers to the fat or thick, succulent, 2″ plant leaves. Ovata means egg-shaped, and refers to the shape of the leaves. All types of jade plants have thick roots, shiny, plump, leaves, and sturdy stems that store water and make the plant drought resistant. When placed in very bright light, some may develop red leaf edges. Certain jade plants produce tiny pink or white star-shaped flowers, not in the summer like most plants, but around Christmas.
Crassula Ovata “jade plant, has solid green, oval leaves and is the most popular jade plant sold.
Crassula ovata “lemon lime” has longer, narrower, oval leaves with light green and pale, yellow stripes.
Crassula “Silver Dollar” has silvery-blue, oval leaves.
Crassula  “Minima” is a compact miniature jade plant.
Crassula Ovata “Skinny fingers” has leaves that resemble thin, upright fingers.

Provide bright light, especially if you want flowers
Water only when the soil is very dry.
Feed a few times in spring and summer. Do not over fertilize.
Watch out for Mealy bugs, Spider mites, and Scale.
A jade plant makes a wonderful houseplant. It is a compact, attractive plant that rarely sheds leaves, thrives on neglect, does not mind dry air, and even flowers indoors.  With a little time and effort, it can be trained to be a bonsai plant. Best of all, the plant is so easy to propagate, either by stem cuttings or by stray leaves that fall onto the soil; it almost propagates itself. A jade plant is a poisonous plant so be careful where you put it in your home.
How much light for a jade plant: This succulent plant grows best in bright, indirect light and morning sun. When there is not enough light, the stems of a jade plant become leggy and bare as they reach for the light.
How to water a jade plant: The main reason a jade plant loses leaves and eventually dies is from over watering due to rot rot. Allow the soil to practically dry out and the leaves to become a little soft and flat before watering.
How to fertilize a jade plant: Feed 2 -3 times in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Use a balanced, liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Moisten the soil with plain water before using water containing the plant food to prevent leaf burn. Be careful not to over fertilize a jade plant.
Best temperature for a jade plant: These plants prefer warm temperatures between 60°-70°F (15°-25°C).
Does a jade plant need high humidity: Low humidity and dry air are not problems for a jade plant.
Does a jade plant flower: A mature plant produces tiny pink or white star-shaped flowers during the winter months.
Jade plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, and scale an be a problem. Never spray a jade plant with a commercial insecticide; it damages the leaves. Use Neem Oil, mild soapy water, or the “Green Solution” (a mixture of 1/ 2 alcohol, 1/2 water, 2tbl. liquid soap, and 2 tbl. mineral oil). Spray all parts of the plant.
Jade plant diseases: Powdery mildew, bacterial root rot, and black ring disease are caused by poor air circulation, wet soil, and wet leaves.
Best soil for a jade plant: Use a loose potting soil that drains quickly.
Do not rush to re-pot a jade plant; it likes to be root – bound. Wait until the roots of the plant have filled the existing container and then move your jade plant to the next size pot and nothing larger. Since these plants tend to get top heavy, use a deep, narrow pot to help support the plant. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape.
Aggressively prune a jade plant to keep it bushy and full. You can use the clippings for propagation.
It is easy to propagate a jade plant using a few healthy leaves from the plant. Place the leaves on the surface of a small pot of loose soil (add perlite or vermiculite to your regular soil). Gently water and then keep the soil barely moist as the new roots develop. You can also propagate a jade plant using a 3″-4″ stem cutting. Allow the stem cutting to sit out for week or two, until the cut end forms a callus, before planting it in a small pot of loose soil. Read more about plant propagation in the Glossary of the website.
A Jade plant, and all members of the Crassula family, are toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets. The sap of the plant is an irritant should be kept away from small children.
Getting Jade plants to flower takes a bit of work. The first thing to remember is that only mature Jade plants get flowers. If you have a mature Jade plant you can get it to bloom by moving the plant to a very bright location, even gradually introducing it to direct sun during the year. Jade plants usually bloom around Christmas in the northern hemisphere. Blooming is triggered by the natural shortening of the daylight hours. If your Jade plant is in a room that gets any light at all at night during late November and December, it will probably not bloom.
Jade plants love to go outside in warm weather. Avoid immediately putting the plant into direct sun since the leaves might burn. You can gradually move into direct sun. Be sure to bring a Jade plant inside before the temperatures go below 45°.
Green leaves usually fall off a Jade plant when it is over-watered. Allow your plant to dry out for at least 2-3 weeks or until the soil is totally dry before watering the plant again. A Jade plant may also lose leaves when it is nitrogen deficient. Try giving it some plant food high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
There is a really simple way to fix a top heavy Jade plant with bare stems. Use your fingernail to make tiny shallow slits up and down the stem. Wherever you make a slight cut in the stem, new leaves will grow. Your Jade plant will be bushy an sturdy in no time."
125,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Asparagus Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/asparagus-fern-how-to-grow-and-care-for/,,,"An asparagus fern (Asparagus aethiopicus) is not a true fern at all but rather a member of the Lily family and a close relative of such plants as the tulip, amaryllis, and hosta. The name asparagus fern comes from the fact that the new growth on these plants resembles tiny asparagus spears. Originally found growing in South Africa, it’s now quite prevalent in subtropical areas in many countries. As asparagus fern is  easier to grow than “true” ferns such as the Boston Fern, Kimberly Queen Fern, or the Maidenhair Fern. During the summer, this is a perfect plant to hang outside in a bright spot on your porch. Just be careful, too much sun or very high temperatures may cause yellow foliage, leaf drop, or brown edges on the “leaflets.”
An asparagus fern has long stems of graceful, feathery, bright green foliage. The tiny “leaves” are not really leaves at all; they are flattened, short, needlelike, modified stems.   The plant looks best in a hanging basket so the arching, trailing stems can grow freely. An asparagus fern produces small white flowers and bright red berries. As the plant matures, stems become a little woody and develop sharp spines. Some asparagus fern varieties, like the springeri, grow over 2-3ft. wide with cascading trailing stems 2ft-4ft.in length.
Asparagus plants are excellent houseplants because they easily adapt to different light levels, temperatures, humidity. Here are are few of the most popular varieties:
Asparagus sprengeri, a cultivar of Asparagus densiflorus, has long, arching stems and tiny needle-like, bright green “leaves;” an added plus are the small white flowers that eventually turn into red berries. Be careful, hidden in the lush foliage of an asparagus sprengeri are sharp little thorns that are difficult to see.
Asparagus plumosa (Asparagus plumosus) is a compact plant with delicate, spreading, horizontal branches covered in feathery “leaves;”
Foxtail Fern (Asparagus Meyeri) has long, bushy fronds that really do resemble a fox’s tail.
 
         
A. plumosa                              A. Sprengeri                     A. Foxtail
Plant dies: usually caused by root rot due to over watering
Foliage turns yellow: usually caused by over watering, too much plant food, very, very dry air, spider mites
Moderately warm temperatures above 55°F (28°C) and below 75°F (23.9°C)
Avoid direct sunlight
Water less in winter and water from the bottom to prevent over watering
Avoid placing the plant near a fireplace, heater, and cold drafts in winter
Plant is easily propagated any time of the years by dividing the root ball
An asparagus fern is a poisonous plant and toxic to cats, dogs, and other pets. Please keep it away from small children who are often attracted by the bright red berries the plant produces. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. 
How much light for an Asparagus Fern: These plants grow best in bright indirect light coming from an east, west, or north-facing window. In lower light an asparagus fern grows very slowly and may develop yellow fronds.
How to water an Asparagus Fern: Do not water until the top 50% of the soil has dried out. If in doubt, allow the fronds to turn pale green before watering. An asparagus fern requires more water in the hot summer months, and likes drier soil during the cold winter months. Asparagus ferns are very drought resistant; however, yellow stems indicate the plant needs more water while brown stems mean you may be over- watering your asparagus fern.
How to fertilize an Asparagus Fern: Feed weekly during the summer with a water-soluble, balanced plant food. Feed monthly during the rest of the year. Always dilute the fertilizer to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for an Asparagus Fern: Temperature should be between 50°-75°F (10°-24°C). These plants can even survive briefly in temperatures as low as 36°F (2.2°C).
Does an Asparagus Fern need high humidity: Since this plant is not really a fern at all, but really a member of the lily family, it does well in normal to low humidity.
Does an Asparagus Fern flower: The plant produces small white flowers, nestled amongst small thorns, that turn into poisonous red berries.
Asparagus Fern plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, aphids, scale and thrip are common pest probems. An asparagus fern can be damaged by commercial pesticides; use a mild solution of insecticidal soap to treat plant pests.
Asparagus Fern plant diseases: Root rot, botrytis, rust, powdery mildew can be a problem. Read more about how to identify and treat these diseases in the Glossary of the website.
What kind of soil for an Asparagus Fern: Use a well- aerated potting soil that drains quickly. If the soil seems too heavy or clay-like and is not draining well, add some sand, perlite, or peat moss.
How big a pot for an Asparagus fern: Being kept root-bound in a small pot, encourages the graceful stems to grow even longer.
How to prune an Asparagus Fern: Quickly remove leaves or stems that turn yellow due to intense heat or light. Prune damaged stems as close to the soil surface as possible.
How to propagate an Asparagus Fern: Plant division, or more specifically tuber division, is the easiest propagation method. The best time of the year to propagate an asparagus fern is in the spring before it starts producing new growth. The root ball full of tubers is often difficult to divide, so have plenty of strong, sharp, clean tools available. Read more about propagating plants by plant division in the Glossary of the website.
An asparagus fern, like many tropical plants, rests during the cooler months. In winter, when the plant is dormant, it requires less water..
An Asparagus Fern is considered a poisonous plant and should be kept away small children , cats, dogs, and birds. Although the leaves are not harmful, the sharp, small thorns can be painful if touched and the red berries are toxic and cause digestive problems if eaten.
Congratulations, berries & flowers develop when an asparagus fern is getting all that it needs. The flowers and berries of an Asparagus Fern won’t hurt the plant, but may slow down the development of new leaves. Please remember the red berries of an Asparagus Fern are poisonous and will cause digestive problems if eaten.
An Asparagus fern gets yellow straw-like vines when the soil has gotten too dry. Cut off the dead vines as close to the soil as possible and water water your asparagus fern really well. Never fertilize a plant when the soil is very dry.
I have my asparagus fern in my bedroom across from a north- facing window. What I want to know is why it isn’t it growing? Your asparagus fern needs a great deal of very bright light to grow well. Try moving it directly in front of a north facing window or better yet to a western or eastern exposure.
An asparagus fern tells you when it needs a new pot. When the the root ball gets too big, the roots are so strong they break the growers pot or start forcing the soil up over the edge of the pot. If this isn’t happening and you still think your fern needs a larger pot, gently pull the fern out of its pot. If the roots have filled the pot and there is very little soil left, it’s time for a new container."
126,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Desert Rose Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/desert-rose-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Desert Rose plant, Adenium Obesum, is a lovely, unique – looking, slow growing succulent plant native to the semi-arid regions of Arabia, the eastern and western parts of Africa, and Madagascar. It’s quite the conversation piece, especially when in bloom, and is very easy to care for. A Desert Rose plant is in the Adenium genus and a member of the Dogbane family, other plants in this family include Vinca (periwinkle), Oleander, and Plumeria.
A Desert Rose plant is a type of caudiciform or “fat plant.” All caudiciforms have a caudex, a thick, bulbous base and fat, swollen trunk and stems. The interesting shape of the caudex can make a Desert Rose plant look like a natural bonsai without any effort on your part. When grown indoors, a Desert Rose plant is about 2ft–5ft tall and 1ft-3 ft wide. It produces sparse, small, leathery green leaves and beautiful 1″-2″ saucer- shaped flowers at the ends of the branches. The flowers are usually red, pink, or white, and the plant is quite a conversation piece when in bloom. The fat, bulbous trunk is partially or completely buried in the soil. It’s important to remember  that a Desert Rose contains a toxic sap that will irritate your skin, eyes, and mouth, and should never be ingested. In Africa, the sap is used to make poison arrows for hunting large animals.
            
No flowers: Not enough light, too much fertilizer, or the plant is still too young to flower
Yellow leaves: Usually due to over watering. The thick leaves stores water and gets soft when the plant needs water or too much direct sun
Green leaves falling off: Soil has gotten too dry
Shriveled, wrinkled caudex: This usually occurs when the plant needs water but can also be an indication of over watering and root rot.
Bright, indirect light
Allow the soil to practically dry out before watering
Feed monthly from May to October
Prefers warm temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C)
Use a soil that drains quickly
Keep in a small pot to prevent over watering
A Desert Rose plant requires very bright, indirect light, especially if you want it to flower.
The fat, bulbous base (caudex) of a Desert Rose stores water, so always allow the soil to practically dry out before watering. If the soil gets excessively dry, the plant becomes dormant; but once you water, leaves quickly start to grow again. The thick base, stems, and roots of a Desert Rose plant become soft and wrinkled when the soil is very dry or when the plant has been over watered and the roots have started to die.
Feed a Desert Rose plant with a fertilizer specifically for flowering plants. The plant food should be lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorous (10/20/10). Feed monthly from late spring until early fall. Always dilute your plant food to one half the recommended strength.
A Desert Rose likes very warm temperatures. Keep the room above 60°F (15.6°C) and avoid placing the plant near air conditioners or cold drafts.
Basic household humidity for a succulent Desert Rose is perfect.
Flowering can occur throughout the year, but is more prolific in the spring and fall. Older plants that are well cared for produce the most blooms. The large, colorful flowers can be red, white, pink, or rose colored.
Aphids, spider mites, scale, and mealy bugsare all atrracted to a Desert Rose. Read more about these plant pests and how to identify and treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Most fungal or bacterial diseases that affect a Desert Rose plant, such as Crown, Root, and Stem Rot are the result of over- watering. It’s also important to keep water off the leaves, flowers, and stems.
Use a loose, fast draining soil mixture. Add hard sand to your usual potting soil to prevent it from becoming heavy and clay-like or use a soil specifically recommended for cactus and succulent plants.
A Desert Rose likes being root-bound in small pot. This helps prevent over-watering and keeps the plant from getting too large.
Prune a Desert Rose any time during the year. Flowers develop on the new growth, so pruning well before the plant blooms encourages more branching and more flowers. Wear gloves and long sleeves to protect yourself from the poisonous sap.
The best way to propagate a Desert Rose is from seeds, but this is rarely possible with an indoor plant. You can try using stem cuttings but the new plants often lack the thick, twisted trunks and fat bases that make a Desert Rose plant so interesting.
A Desert Rose often goes dormant during the winter and may drop leaves. Reduce watering during this time and do not fertilize.
A Desert Rose plant is a very poisonous houseplant with a #2 Toxicity Level.
Leaves fall off a Desert Rose plant when it is over-watered. This is a succulent plant that requires very little water.
Here are a few hints that might help your Desert Rose plant develop a thicker trunk. When you re-pot your Desert Rose, lift the root ball higher in the new pot so that the top part of the roots is exposed. Feed with a good fertilizer high in phosphorus. This should help the trunk of your Desert Rose become more bulbous.
You need to aggressively prune your Desert Rose plant if you want it to look better. Cut back two or three of the stems almost to the main trunk, and place the plant in bright light. The new growth should start within three or four weeks. Once the new growth starts to develop, cut another two stems back. Check our Glossary under propagation/ plant cuttings to see how you can use these Stem Cuttings to start new plants.
A Desert Rose plant requires a great deal of bright light to flower. It also need to be fed with a fertilizer high in phosphorous, that’s the middle number on a plant food package (10/20/10), in order to bloom. A Desert Rose flowers more in the spring and fall than in summer and winter."
127,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Hoya Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/hoya-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"There are over 200 species of the easy to grow, almost indestructible hoya plant. Hoya plants are often referred to as  wax plant, wax Vine, or wax flower because of the waxy nature of their leaves and unique flowers. Most varieties were originally found growing in the warm temperate climates of  India, Thailand, the Philippines, Polynesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. There are also many that are native to Australia. The leaves come in many shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. Hoyas are very popular flowering plants that look beautiful hanging in a warm, bright, area of your home.
A hoya plant is a trailing or climbing plant with thick, succulent leaves. The leaves come in many sizes, colors, shapes, and textures. All hoya plants  produce clusters of waxy, star shaped flowers from late spring to early autumn. Hoya carnosa is the basic species we use as an indoor plant. There are several different varieties of  this species available.
Hoya Carnosa has long vines of green, fleshy leaves and waxy, star shaped flowers
Hoya “Krimson Queen” (Hoya Carnosa ‘Variegata’) has variegated green leaves with pink, white, or cream-colored edges.
Hoya Krimson Princess (Tricolor hoya) has leaves with green edges and white, pink, yellow, or dark pink depending on the amount of light available in the room
Hindu Rope plant (hoya carnosa compacta), has thick, twisted, curly, cupped leaves which is how it got its nickname Krinkle Kurl.
There are over 50 other hoya plant varieties such as the Hoya Kerri (Sweetheart hoya) with heart-shaped leaves and the Hoya pubicalyx with elongated, oval leaves that make great houseplants. Most varieties grown indoors produce clusters, called umbels, of five-pointed, star shaped, fragrant flowers in red, white, pink, purple, yellow, orange, and even black.
            
Hindu Rope        K. Crimson Queen        Hoya Flower                 H.Sweetheart     H. Crimson Princess
Light – Bright, indirect light and some morning sun
Water – Barely moist but never soggy soil, water less in the fall and winter
Temperature – Average warm temperatures, but prefers cooler temperatures in winter
Flowering – Do not move the plant once buds appear and do not remove dead flowers
A hoya plant is a semi- succulent, very forgiving, green gem perfect to hang in front of a bright sunny window. They are easy to propagate using stem tip cuttings if you want to share your plant with friends and family.  Even a plant novice will be successful growing a hoya if they are careful not to over-water.
How much light for a hoya plant: These plants grow faster and bloom more often in very bright, indirect light. They are one of the few indoor plants that can handle direct morning sun. Although a hoya plant can adapt to lower light, growth is slower and there are less flowers.
How to water a hoya plant: This is a succulent plant that stores water in its leaves. Allow the top several inches of soil to dry out before watering. Although somewhat drought resistant, they do need additional water when in bloom. Water less during fall and winter. If your water contains fluorine or chlorine, allow it to sit out 24 hours or more before using it so the chemicals can dissipate. Fluorine, chlorine, and salt are harmful to a hoya plant.
How to fertilize a hoya plant: Feed monthly, when the plant is actively growing, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a hoya plant: Temperatures of 65°F – 80°F (18.3°- 26.7°C ) during the day and 60°F – 65°F (15.6°C – 18.3°C) at night are best. If the temperature is too cold or a hoya plant is sitting in a cold draft, it may drop leaves.
How much humidity does a hoya plant need: Basic household humidity or lower is fine for this succulent plant.
How to help a hoya plant to flower: A mature hoya plant (3 plus yrs) produces beautiful clusters of fragrant flowers in numerous colors. Each hoya flower has five waxy petals. New flowers develop on the older stems so never cut off the old flower stems. The ideal location indoors is right in front of a window facing east or west so the plant can get a few hours of morning sun. Provide bright, indirect light the rest of the day. In winter, when the plant is resting, allow the soil to practically dry out completely before watering; this helps it bloom more the rest of the year. The flowers grow in an “umbel,” like an upside down umbrella, and there may be one to fifty flowers in each umbel. Unlike other plants, a hoya does NOT like to be dead headed so never remove the dead flowers.
Hoya plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids can be a problem. Spray the entire plant, reaching every little twisted section if possible, with the nontoxic “Green Solution” that is very effective against all types of houseplant pests. Read instructions on how to make the Green Solution in the Glossary of the website.
Hoya plant diseases: The main diseases to keep an eye out for are botrytis, a fungus that causes grayish areas on the leaves, and crown, stem; and root rot, a fungal disease caused by humid warm conditions, wet leaves, soggy soil, and poor air circulation.
Best soil for a hoya plant: Use a well-aerated fast-draining potting soil. Add a little sand to the soil if it seems too heavy and is not drying out quickly.
Pot size for a hoya plant: Keep the plant in a small pot that has drip holes in the bottom to prevent over-watering.
How to prune a hoya plant: Never cut off the old stems since this is where the new flowers develop. Never cut off the dead flowers.
Hoya plants are easy to propagate using stem tip cuttings from the new vines. Read more about propagation using stem tip cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Hoya plants rest during the winter months and require even less water than usual.
Although not considered poisonous, hoya plants may make dogs and cats ill if they eat a large number of the leaves.
Indoors, hoya plants need to be about 3 years old and sit in very bright light in order to bloom. Never cut off the older stems because that is where the flowers will grow.
Not a good idea!! New flowers develop on the old flower stems of a hoya plant so never cut off the old stems.
You can try to get rid of Mealy Bugs on hoya plants by spraying the entire plant with the ” green solution” (8oz. water & 8oz. alcohol, add two tablespoons of biodegradable soap and two tablespoons of mineral oil). You can read more about this simple remedy in the Glossary of the website. You can also purchase a very small pesticide bomb at your local nursery. Place your plant in a plastic bag, release the bomb, and seal the plastic bag. Leave your Hoya in the bag for 24 hours. I prefer the ” green solution” since it doesn’t use chemicals."
128,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/13,Azalea,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/azalea-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"An Azalea plant is the national flower of Nepal, and is part of an ancient group of plants dating back million of years. They are related to rhododendrons and blueberries and are descendents of Asian shrubs. Azaleas can also be used as a centerpiece for weddings or to replace expensive cut flower arrangements in your home or office. Azaleas have delicate, funnel shaped,  lipped flowers that can be red, pink, white, yellow, purple and even bi-color. These plants are considered poisonous and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. Azalea plants have terminal blooms which means the entire plant flowers at one time making a beautiful display. Since florist azaleas are different than specially grown outdoor azaleas,  indoor azalea plants that you receive as a gift rarely do well planted outside in your garden.
Azalea plants require bright indirect light while blooming, but no direct sun. If there is not enough light, the flower buds on an azalea plant won’t open.
Allow the top 2″-3″ of soil to dry out before watering. Azaleas are acid loving plants; if your water is alkaline add one tablespoon of vinegar to each gallon of water. You can also water azaleas with leftover tea. Large numbers of leaves drop off if the soil is too wet or too dry.
Fertilize monthly with an acidic fertilizer diluted to 1/3 the recommended strength. Never fertilize your azalea plant when it is in bloom.
Azalea plants thrive and their flowers last longer when the temperature is 50°-60°F (10°-15.6°C) at night and 60°-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C)F during the day. Temperatures over 80°F (26.7°C) cause leaf drop and flowers to quickly fade.
Azalea plants do well in normal to high humidity.
When purchasing an azalea for yourself or as a gift, buy one that has buds barely showing a little color as well as open flowers. Once brought home, place your new azalea in a bright, cool location, away from heaters, air conditioners, and direct sun. This should keep the plant in bloom for quite a while.
Azalea plants are susceptible to spider mites, scale, and nematodes.
Azalea gall occurs in early spring. New leaves curl, become pale, turn brown and die. Petal blight, powdery mildew, and rust are all types of fungus that can infect azaleas. Remove diseased leaves as soon as they appear and spray with a fungicide.
Use a rich acidic planting mixture that drains well.
Azaleas can be found in 4″, 6″, and 8″ pots.
Remove dead flowers as soon as they appear and prune bare branches.
Azalea plants are propagated by stem cuttings, grafts, and tissue culture, but it is a difficult process. I recommend leaving it to the professionals.
After your azalea has finished blooming and you’ve pruned it, move the plant to a cool room with less light. Keep the soil a little drier than usual and fertilize monthly. After several months, when buds start to appear, move your azalea back into bright indirect light.
Azaleas are lovely flowering plants that make a perfect gift for Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, anniversaries, birthdays, and as a get well present.
All parts of an Azalea contain a substance called grayanotoxin which makes the plant very poisonous with a #4 toxicity level. Keep azalea plants away from children and pets.
Leaves fall off an azalea plant for several reasons: The temperature is too hot or the humidity too low. The soil is too wet or the soil is too dry. The azalea plant is in a draft, near a cold door, or in front of a drafty window.
You can get an azalea to bloom again indoors but it’s not easy. Azalea plants require about 6 weeks of very cool 40°-50°F(4.4°-10°C) nighttime temperatures for their buds to set. High humidity is also necessary. Once the buds develop, move your plant to a warmer, brighter location. Indoor azalea plants may re-bloom once a year if you’re lucky.
Here are a few tips that might help the flowers on your azalea plants last a little longer. When you buy an azalea, select a plant that has only a few open flowers and mostly buds. The buds should be showing a little color. At home, place your new azalea in a bright, cool location, away from heaters, air conditioners, and direct sun. This should keep the plant in bloom for at least a few weeks.
Your azalea plant has probably gotten too dry and the soil has contracted so much that the water runs right through without being absorbed. Place the entire plant, pot and all, in a bucket or sink full of water and hold it there until the air bubbles stop coming out of the soil. Once all of the air has escaped and the soil has expanded, your azalea plant should be able to absorb water normally again."

A dieffenbachia plant, or “Dumb Cane” plant as it is sometimes called, is a member of the Araceae family and a relative of the Anthurium, Caladium, Calla Lily, and Monstera Deliciosa. All plants in the Araceae family contain calcium oxalate crystals and are very poisonous. The sap from these plants is a severe irritant. A dieffenbachia got its nickname “Dumb Cane plant” because the toxic effect of the oxalates can cause a temporary inability to speak.A dieffenbachia plant grows outdoors in moderate climates where the temperature stays above 60°F (15.6°C). The plant can survive in lower temperatures but does not grow well. Indoors, learning how to care for a dieffenbachia plant is relatively easy if you remember that the plant needs bright light, but no direct sun, barely moist soil, and fertilizer on a regular basis
A dieffenbachia plant has straight, thick stems and alternate, large, broad, pointed, oblong leaves. When placed in front of a window and never turned, the stems bend towards the light source.  An outdoor dieffenbachia plant can grow as tall as 8ft-10 ft. and have huge leaves 15”-20” long. Indoors the leaves of a dieffenbachia are usually about 3″- 6″ wide and 6″ or more in length. As the plant matures and gets larger, and if it is properly pruned, it becomes a spectacular, bushy, floor plant. Dieffenbachias are fast-growing houseplants that get top heavy as they grow taller. Repotting them into a deep, narrow, heavy pot helps solve the problem. Giving the plant a 1/4 turn every time you water keeps a dieffenbachia growing straight up.  The decorative patterns on the leaves can be cream, white, light, and dark green,  yellow, and even pink.
Some of the most popular dieffenbachia varieties are the Tropic Snow, Camille, Amoena, Maculata, Seguine, Compacta, and Maryanne. The dieffenbachia “Starbright” even has some pink variation in the leaves.
     
D. Camille                     D. Maculata carina        D. Marianne               D.  Starbright
Leaves have brown edges: Cold drafts and allowing the soil to dry out too
Leaves become pale: Direct sun or too much very bright indirect light
Bottom of the main stem becomes soft and mushy: Overwatering and cold temperatures
Lower leaves yellow and droopy: Cold drafts, temperatures below 50,°  lack of light
  
All parts of a dieffenbachia plant are extremely poisonous and the plant should be kept away from children, dogs, cats, and other pets. Aways wear long sleeves and gloves when pruning or repotting. Clean your tools and swash your hands vigorously when finished caring for the plant.  Avoid putting your hands near your eyes and mouth when working with the plant. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant requires medium to bright, indirect light; but no direct sun. Direct sun burns the leaves and even too much bright light causes the vibrant leaf color to fade. When an indoor dieffenbachia does not get enough light, the new leaves are small and far apart on the stem.
How to water a dieffenbachia plant: Water well and then allow the top 2″-3″ of the soil to dry out before watering again. A dieffenbachia plant does best when watered on a regular schedule. If the soil gets too dry, the bottom leaves may turn yellow. If a dieffenbachia plant is over- watered, the plant stems get soft and mushy and the plant starts to die.
How to fertilize a dieffenbachia: Feed a dieffenbachia only when the plant is actively producing new leaves. Most dieffenbachia plants need to be fed every two weeks in the summer and once a month in the spring and fall. Never fertilize a dieffenbachia in the winter. Excess plant food causes browning around the edges of the leaves.
Best temperature for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant prefer temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C). The lower leaves on the plant turn yellow when exposed to cold drafts from doors, windows, or air conditioners.
How much humidity does a dieffenbachia plant need: High humidity is a plus for a dieffenbachia, but the plant still does well in basic household humidity.
Does a dieffenbachia plant flower: A dieffenbachia plant develops non-descript, spath-like flowers. Since the flowers slow leaf development, I recommend cutting the flowers off as soon as they appear.
Dieffenbachia plant pests: Spider mites and mealy bugs are two plant pests that can damage a dieffenbachia plant.Read more about bth of these pests in the Glossary of the website.
Dieffenbachia plant diseases: Since a dieffenbachia likes high humidity, it may get bacterial leaf spot, erwinia blight, and other bacterial diseases that often develop in humid conditions. Keep the leaves dry and provide good air circulation around the plant to prevent diseases.
Best soil for a dieffenbachia plant: The best soil for a dieffenbachia plant is a rich, organic mixture that drains quickly.
What size pot for a dieffenbachia plant: A dieffenbachia plant likes to be a little root-bound. Repot t in the spring if the roots have filled the existing pot. The new dieffenbachia plant container should be only one size larger and must have drip holes in the bottom.
How to prune a dieffenbachia plant: Aggressively prune a dieffenbachia plant to keep it bushy and to prevent the plant from getting top heavy. Always wear a long sleeve shirt and gloves when pruning; this prevents the toxic, irritating sap from getting on your skin. Never touch your eyes or mouth when pruning a dieffenbachia. Wash your tools thoroughly with some bleach when finished pruning.
How to propagate a dieffenbachia plant: The best way to propagate a dieffenbachia plant is by air layering if the stem is very thick, or by stem cuttings if the stems are thin. You can read more about these propagation methods in the Glossary of the website.
A dieffenbachia plant is extremely poisonous with a #4 toxicity level and very toxic to cats, dogs, and small children. If the sap from a dieffenbachia gets on your skin, wash it off immediately. Seek medical advice if a child or pet ingests any part of a dieffenbachia plant.
I know this will be hard, but the best way to keep a top-heavy dieffenbachia from falling over is to cut off the top 1/3-1/2 of the plant. The remaining dieffenbachia plant will send out new growth and quickly become sturdy and bushy. You can remove a few of the bottom leaves from the dieffenbachia section you cut off and use it to propagate a new plant. Always wear gloves when pruning!! Dieffenbachia sap is very toxic and can irritate the skin and inflame existing cuts or sores.
The bottom leaves on a dieffenbachia plant may turn yellow if the the plant is near a cold draft or an air conditioning vent; if the bottom of the dieffenbachia plant is not getting enough light; or if the dieffenbachia soil gotten too dry.
The edges of the leaves of a dieffenbachia plant usually turn brown from too much fertilizer or too much salt in water in the water you are using. Never use water that has passed through a water softener; it is much too salty for plants. Rinse the soil with distilled water several times to get rid of any unwanted chemicals.
It is normal for a dieffenbachia to lose its bottom leaves especially if it is not getting enough light. If your dieffenbachia plant is looking bare, cut off the top 1/3 of the plant stem. Cutting off the top of a dieffenbachia encourages the plant to send out new growth along the resining main stem and produce new stems from the roots."
130,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Jade Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/jade-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A jade plant, Crassula ovata, has become a very popular, succulent houseplant because of how easy it is to care for.  (Nicknames for the plant are Friendship plant, Silver Dollar plant, Chinese Rubber plant, Money Tree plant, Money plant, and Lucky plant. A jade plant got the name “Money Plant” because, according the Feng Shui,  having it in your home, business, or office brings you prosperity and good luck. Do not confuse this plant with the Pachira Aquatica also called a Money plant or the Pilea peperomiodes (Chinese Money plant). Originally found in the dry hills of South Africa, it is very tolerant of all types of conditions except one – over watering.
A jade plant is a green friend that just won’t die! It got the name jade plant because of its resemblance to the jade gemstone. Today, there are many different varieties and cultivars available, with different leaf colors, patterns, and leaf shapes. The Crassula ovata remains the most the most popular. The scientific name is a perfect description of what the plant looks like. “Crassula” is latin for thick, and refers to the fat or thick, succulent, 2″ plant leaves. Ovata means egg-shaped, and refers to the shape of the leaves. All types of jade plants have thick roots, shiny, plump, leaves, and sturdy stems that store water and make the plant drought resistant. When placed in very bright light, some may develop red leaf edges. Certain jade plants produce tiny pink or white star-shaped flowers, not in the summer like most plants, but around Christmas.
Crassula Ovata “jade plant, has solid green, oval leaves and is the most popular jade plant sold.
Crassula ovata “lemon lime” has longer, narrower, oval leaves with light green and pale, yellow stripes.
Crassula “Silver Dollar” has silvery-blue, oval leaves.
Crassula  “Minima” is a compact miniature jade plant.
Crassula Ovata “Skinny fingers” has leaves that resemble thin, upright fingers.

Provide bright light, especially if you want flowers
Water only when the soil is very dry.
Feed a few times in spring and summer. Do not over fertilize.
Watch out for Mealy bugs, Spider mites, and Scale.
A jade plant makes a wonderful houseplant. It is a compact, attractive plant that rarely sheds leaves, thrives on neglect, does not mind dry air, and even flowers indoors.  With a little time and effort, it can be trained to be a bonsai plant. Best of all, the plant is so easy to propagate, either by stem cuttings or by stray leaves that fall onto the soil; it almost propagates itself. A jade plant is a poisonous plant so be careful where you put it in your home.
How much light for a jade plant: This succulent plant grows best in bright, indirect light and morning sun. When there is not enough light, the stems of a jade plant become leggy and bare as they reach for the light.
How to water a jade plant: The main reason a jade plant loses leaves and eventually dies is from over watering due to rot rot. Allow the soil to practically dry out and the leaves to become a little soft and flat before watering.
How to fertilize a jade plant: Feed 2 -3 times in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Use a balanced, liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Moisten the soil with plain water before using water containing the plant food to prevent leaf burn. Be careful not to over fertilize a jade plant.
Best temperature for a jade plant: These plants prefer warm temperatures between 60°-70°F (15°-25°C).
Does a jade plant need high humidity: Low humidity and dry air are not problems for a jade plant.
Does a jade plant flower: A mature plant produces tiny pink or white star-shaped flowers during the winter months.
Jade plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, and scale an be a problem. Never spray a jade plant with a commercial insecticide; it damages the leaves. Use Neem Oil, mild soapy water, or the “Green Solution” (a mixture of 1/ 2 alcohol, 1/2 water, 2tbl. liquid soap, and 2 tbl. mineral oil). Spray all parts of the plant.
Jade plant diseases: Powdery mildew, bacterial root rot, and black ring disease are caused by poor air circulation, wet soil, and wet leaves.
Best soil for a jade plant: Use a loose potting soil that drains quickly.
Do not rush to re-pot a jade plant; it likes to be root – bound. Wait until the roots of the plant have filled the existing container and then move your jade plant to the next size pot and nothing larger. Since these plants tend to get top heavy, use a deep, narrow pot to help support the plant. There must be drip holes in the bottom of the pot so excess water can escape.
Aggressively prune a jade plant to keep it bushy and full. You can use the clippings for propagation.
It is easy to propagate a jade plant using a few healthy leaves from the plant. Place the leaves on the surface of a small pot of loose soil (add perlite or vermiculite to your regular soil). Gently water and then keep the soil barely moist as the new roots develop. You can also propagate a jade plant using a 3″-4″ stem cutting. Allow the stem cutting to sit out for week or two, until the cut end forms a callus, before planting it in a small pot of loose soil. Read more about plant propagation in the Glossary of the website.
A Jade plant, and all members of the Crassula family, are toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets. The sap of the plant is an irritant should be kept away from small children.
Getting Jade plants to flower takes a bit of work. The first thing to remember is that only mature Jade plants get flowers. If you have a mature Jade plant you can get it to bloom by moving the plant to a very bright location, even gradually introducing it to direct sun during the year. Jade plants usually bloom around Christmas in the northern hemisphere. Blooming is triggered by the natural shortening of the daylight hours. If your Jade plant is in a room that gets any light at all at night during late November and December, it will probably not bloom.
Jade plants love to go outside in warm weather. Avoid immediately putting the plant into direct sun since the leaves might burn. You can gradually move into direct sun. Be sure to bring a Jade plant inside before the temperatures go below 45°.
Green leaves usually fall off a Jade plant when it is over-watered. Allow your plant to dry out for at least 2-3 weeks or until the soil is totally dry before watering the plant again. A Jade plant may also lose leaves when it is nitrogen deficient. Try giving it some plant food high in nitrogen diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
There is a really simple way to fix a top heavy Jade plant with bare stems. Use your fingernail to make tiny shallow slits up and down the stem. Wherever you make a slight cut in the stem, new leaves will grow. Your Jade plant will be bushy an sturdy in no time."
131,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Asparagus Fern,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/asparagus-fern-how-to-grow-and-care-for/,,,"An asparagus fern (Asparagus aethiopicus) is not a true fern at all but rather a member of the Lily family and a close relative of such plants as the tulip, amaryllis, and hosta. The name asparagus fern comes from the fact that the new growth on these plants resembles tiny asparagus spears. Originally found growing in South Africa, it’s now quite prevalent in subtropical areas in many countries. As asparagus fern is  easier to grow than “true” ferns such as the Boston Fern, Kimberly Queen Fern, or the Maidenhair Fern. During the summer, this is a perfect plant to hang outside in a bright spot on your porch. Just be careful, too much sun or very high temperatures may cause yellow foliage, leaf drop, or brown edges on the “leaflets.”
An asparagus fern has long stems of graceful, feathery, bright green foliage. The tiny “leaves” are not really leaves at all; they are flattened, short, needlelike, modified stems.   The plant looks best in a hanging basket so the arching, trailing stems can grow freely. An asparagus fern produces small white flowers and bright red berries. As the plant matures, stems become a little woody and develop sharp spines. Some asparagus fern varieties, like the springeri, grow over 2-3ft. wide with cascading trailing stems 2ft-4ft.in length.
Asparagus plants are excellent houseplants because they easily adapt to different light levels, temperatures, humidity. Here are are few of the most popular varieties:
Asparagus sprengeri, a cultivar of Asparagus densiflorus, has long, arching stems and tiny needle-like, bright green “leaves;” an added plus are the small white flowers that eventually turn into red berries. Be careful, hidden in the lush foliage of an asparagus sprengeri are sharp little thorns that are difficult to see.
Asparagus plumosa (Asparagus plumosus) is a compact plant with delicate, spreading, horizontal branches covered in feathery “leaves;”
Foxtail Fern (Asparagus Meyeri) has long, bushy fronds that really do resemble a fox’s tail.
 
         
A. plumosa                              A. Sprengeri                     A. Foxtail
Plant dies: usually caused by root rot due to over watering
Foliage turns yellow: usually caused by over watering, too much plant food, very, very dry air, spider mites
Moderately warm temperatures above 55°F (28°C) and below 75°F (23.9°C)
Avoid direct sunlight
Water less in winter and water from the bottom to prevent over watering
Avoid placing the plant near a fireplace, heater, and cold drafts in winter
Plant is easily propagated any time of the years by dividing the root ball
An asparagus fern is a poisonous plant and toxic to cats, dogs, and other pets. Please keep it away from small children who are often attracted by the bright red berries the plant produces. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants. 
How much light for an Asparagus Fern: These plants grow best in bright indirect light coming from an east, west, or north-facing window. In lower light an asparagus fern grows very slowly and may develop yellow fronds.
How to water an Asparagus Fern: Do not water until the top 50% of the soil has dried out. If in doubt, allow the fronds to turn pale green before watering. An asparagus fern requires more water in the hot summer months, and likes drier soil during the cold winter months. Asparagus ferns are very drought resistant; however, yellow stems indicate the plant needs more water while brown stems mean you may be over- watering your asparagus fern.
How to fertilize an Asparagus Fern: Feed weekly during the summer with a water-soluble, balanced plant food. Feed monthly during the rest of the year. Always dilute the fertilizer to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for an Asparagus Fern: Temperature should be between 50°-75°F (10°-24°C). These plants can even survive briefly in temperatures as low as 36°F (2.2°C).
Does an Asparagus Fern need high humidity: Since this plant is not really a fern at all, but really a member of the lily family, it does well in normal to low humidity.
Does an Asparagus Fern flower: The plant produces small white flowers, nestled amongst small thorns, that turn into poisonous red berries.
Asparagus Fern plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, aphids, scale and thrip are common pest probems. An asparagus fern can be damaged by commercial pesticides; use a mild solution of insecticidal soap to treat plant pests.
Asparagus Fern plant diseases: Root rot, botrytis, rust, powdery mildew can be a problem. Read more about how to identify and treat these diseases in the Glossary of the website.
What kind of soil for an Asparagus Fern: Use a well- aerated potting soil that drains quickly. If the soil seems too heavy or clay-like and is not draining well, add some sand, perlite, or peat moss.
How big a pot for an Asparagus fern: Being kept root-bound in a small pot, encourages the graceful stems to grow even longer.
How to prune an Asparagus Fern: Quickly remove leaves or stems that turn yellow due to intense heat or light. Prune damaged stems as close to the soil surface as possible.
How to propagate an Asparagus Fern: Plant division, or more specifically tuber division, is the easiest propagation method. The best time of the year to propagate an asparagus fern is in the spring before it starts producing new growth. The root ball full of tubers is often difficult to divide, so have plenty of strong, sharp, clean tools available. Read more about propagating plants by plant division in the Glossary of the website.
An asparagus fern, like many tropical plants, rests during the cooler months. In winter, when the plant is dormant, it requires less water..
An Asparagus Fern is considered a poisonous plant and should be kept away small children , cats, dogs, and birds. Although the leaves are not harmful, the sharp, small thorns can be painful if touched and the red berries are toxic and cause digestive problems if eaten.
Congratulations, berries & flowers develop when an asparagus fern is getting all that it needs. The flowers and berries of an Asparagus Fern won’t hurt the plant, but may slow down the development of new leaves. Please remember the red berries of an Asparagus Fern are poisonous and will cause digestive problems if eaten.
An Asparagus fern gets yellow straw-like vines when the soil has gotten too dry. Cut off the dead vines as close to the soil as possible and water water your asparagus fern really well. Never fertilize a plant when the soil is very dry.
I have my asparagus fern in my bedroom across from a north- facing window. What I want to know is why it isn’t it growing? Your asparagus fern needs a great deal of very bright light to grow well. Try moving it directly in front of a north facing window or better yet to a western or eastern exposure.
An asparagus fern tells you when it needs a new pot. When the the root ball gets too big, the roots are so strong they break the growers pot or start forcing the soil up over the edge of the pot. If this isn’t happening and you still think your fern needs a larger pot, gently pull the fern out of its pot. If the roots have filled the pot and there is very little soil left, it’s time for a new container."
132,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Desert Rose Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/desert-rose-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Desert Rose plant, Adenium Obesum, is a lovely, unique – looking, slow growing succulent plant native to the semi-arid regions of Arabia, the eastern and western parts of Africa, and Madagascar. It’s quite the conversation piece, especially when in bloom, and is very easy to care for. A Desert Rose plant is in the Adenium genus and a member of the Dogbane family, other plants in this family include Vinca (periwinkle), Oleander, and Plumeria.
A Desert Rose plant is a type of caudiciform or “fat plant.” All caudiciforms have a caudex, a thick, bulbous base and fat, swollen trunk and stems. The interesting shape of the caudex can make a Desert Rose plant look like a natural bonsai without any effort on your part. When grown indoors, a Desert Rose plant is about 2ft–5ft tall and 1ft-3 ft wide. It produces sparse, small, leathery green leaves and beautiful 1″-2″ saucer- shaped flowers at the ends of the branches. The flowers are usually red, pink, or white, and the plant is quite a conversation piece when in bloom. The fat, bulbous trunk is partially or completely buried in the soil. It’s important to remember  that a Desert Rose contains a toxic sap that will irritate your skin, eyes, and mouth, and should never be ingested. In Africa, the sap is used to make poison arrows for hunting large animals.
            
No flowers: Not enough light, too much fertilizer, or the plant is still too young to flower
Yellow leaves: Usually due to over watering. The thick leaves stores water and gets soft when the plant needs water or too much direct sun
Green leaves falling off: Soil has gotten too dry
Shriveled, wrinkled caudex: This usually occurs when the plant needs water but can also be an indication of over watering and root rot.
Bright, indirect light
Allow the soil to practically dry out before watering
Feed monthly from May to October
Prefers warm temperatures above 60°F (15.6°C)
Use a soil that drains quickly
Keep in a small pot to prevent over watering
A Desert Rose plant requires very bright, indirect light, especially if you want it to flower.
The fat, bulbous base (caudex) of a Desert Rose stores water, so always allow the soil to practically dry out before watering. If the soil gets excessively dry, the plant becomes dormant; but once you water, leaves quickly start to grow again. The thick base, stems, and roots of a Desert Rose plant become soft and wrinkled when the soil is very dry or when the plant has been over watered and the roots have started to die.
Feed a Desert Rose plant with a fertilizer specifically for flowering plants. The plant food should be lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorous (10/20/10). Feed monthly from late spring until early fall. Always dilute your plant food to one half the recommended strength.
A Desert Rose likes very warm temperatures. Keep the room above 60°F (15.6°C) and avoid placing the plant near air conditioners or cold drafts.
Basic household humidity for a succulent Desert Rose is perfect.
Flowering can occur throughout the year, but is more prolific in the spring and fall. Older plants that are well cared for produce the most blooms. The large, colorful flowers can be red, white, pink, or rose colored.
Aphids, spider mites, scale, and mealy bugsare all atrracted to a Desert Rose. Read more about these plant pests and how to identify and treat them in the Glossary of the website.
Most fungal or bacterial diseases that affect a Desert Rose plant, such as Crown, Root, and Stem Rot are the result of over- watering. It’s also important to keep water off the leaves, flowers, and stems.
Use a loose, fast draining soil mixture. Add hard sand to your usual potting soil to prevent it from becoming heavy and clay-like or use a soil specifically recommended for cactus and succulent plants.
A Desert Rose likes being root-bound in small pot. This helps prevent over-watering and keeps the plant from getting too large.
Prune a Desert Rose any time during the year. Flowers develop on the new growth, so pruning well before the plant blooms encourages more branching and more flowers. Wear gloves and long sleeves to protect yourself from the poisonous sap.
The best way to propagate a Desert Rose is from seeds, but this is rarely possible with an indoor plant. You can try using stem cuttings but the new plants often lack the thick, twisted trunks and fat bases that make a Desert Rose plant so interesting.
A Desert Rose often goes dormant during the winter and may drop leaves. Reduce watering during this time and do not fertilize.
A Desert Rose plant is a very poisonous houseplant with a #2 Toxicity Level.
Leaves fall off a Desert Rose plant when it is over-watered. This is a succulent plant that requires very little water.
Here are a few hints that might help your Desert Rose plant develop a thicker trunk. When you re-pot your Desert Rose, lift the root ball higher in the new pot so that the top part of the roots is exposed. Feed with a good fertilizer high in phosphorus. This should help the trunk of your Desert Rose become more bulbous.
You need to aggressively prune your Desert Rose plant if you want it to look better. Cut back two or three of the stems almost to the main trunk, and place the plant in bright light. The new growth should start within three or four weeks. Once the new growth starts to develop, cut another two stems back. Check our Glossary under propagation/ plant cuttings to see how you can use these Stem Cuttings to start new plants.
A Desert Rose plant requires a great deal of bright light to flower. It also need to be fed with a fertilizer high in phosphorous, that’s the middle number on a plant food package (10/20/10), in order to bloom. A Desert Rose flowers more in the spring and fall than in summer and winter."
133,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Hoya Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/hoya-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"There are over 200 species of the easy to grow, almost indestructible hoya plant. Hoya plants are often referred to as  wax plant, wax Vine, or wax flower because of the waxy nature of their leaves and unique flowers. Most varieties were originally found growing in the warm temperate climates of  India, Thailand, the Philippines, Polynesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. There are also many that are native to Australia. The leaves come in many shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. Hoyas are very popular flowering plants that look beautiful hanging in a warm, bright, area of your home.
A hoya plant is a trailing or climbing plant with thick, succulent leaves. The leaves come in many sizes, colors, shapes, and textures. All hoya plants  produce clusters of waxy, star shaped flowers from late spring to early autumn. Hoya carnosa is the basic species we use as an indoor plant. There are several different varieties of  this species available.
Hoya Carnosa has long vines of green, fleshy leaves and waxy, star shaped flowers
Hoya “Krimson Queen” (Hoya Carnosa ‘Variegata’) has variegated green leaves with pink, white, or cream-colored edges.
Hoya Krimson Princess (Tricolor hoya) has leaves with green edges and white, pink, yellow, or dark pink depending on the amount of light available in the room
Hindu Rope plant (hoya carnosa compacta), has thick, twisted, curly, cupped leaves which is how it got its nickname Krinkle Kurl.
There are over 50 other hoya plant varieties such as the Hoya Kerri (Sweetheart hoya) with heart-shaped leaves and the Hoya pubicalyx with elongated, oval leaves that make great houseplants. Most varieties grown indoors produce clusters, called umbels, of five-pointed, star shaped, fragrant flowers in red, white, pink, purple, yellow, orange, and even black.
            
Hindu Rope        K. Crimson Queen        Hoya Flower                 H.Sweetheart     H. Crimson Princess
Light – Bright, indirect light and some morning sun
Water – Barely moist but never soggy soil, water less in the fall and winter
Temperature – Average warm temperatures, but prefers cooler temperatures in winter
Flowering – Do not move the plant once buds appear and do not remove dead flowers
A hoya plant is a semi- succulent, very forgiving, green gem perfect to hang in front of a bright sunny window. They are easy to propagate using stem tip cuttings if you want to share your plant with friends and family.  Even a plant novice will be successful growing a hoya if they are careful not to over-water.
How much light for a hoya plant: These plants grow faster and bloom more often in very bright, indirect light. They are one of the few indoor plants that can handle direct morning sun. Although a hoya plant can adapt to lower light, growth is slower and there are less flowers.
How to water a hoya plant: This is a succulent plant that stores water in its leaves. Allow the top several inches of soil to dry out before watering. Although somewhat drought resistant, they do need additional water when in bloom. Water less during fall and winter. If your water contains fluorine or chlorine, allow it to sit out 24 hours or more before using it so the chemicals can dissipate. Fluorine, chlorine, and salt are harmful to a hoya plant.
How to fertilize a hoya plant: Feed monthly, when the plant is actively growing, with a balanced plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Best temperature for a hoya plant: Temperatures of 65°F – 80°F (18.3°- 26.7°C ) during the day and 60°F – 65°F (15.6°C – 18.3°C) at night are best. If the temperature is too cold or a hoya plant is sitting in a cold draft, it may drop leaves.
How much humidity does a hoya plant need: Basic household humidity or lower is fine for this succulent plant.
How to help a hoya plant to flower: A mature hoya plant (3 plus yrs) produces beautiful clusters of fragrant flowers in numerous colors. Each hoya flower has five waxy petals. New flowers develop on the older stems so never cut off the old flower stems. The ideal location indoors is right in front of a window facing east or west so the plant can get a few hours of morning sun. Provide bright, indirect light the rest of the day. In winter, when the plant is resting, allow the soil to practically dry out completely before watering; this helps it bloom more the rest of the year. The flowers grow in an “umbel,” like an upside down umbrella, and there may be one to fifty flowers in each umbel. Unlike other plants, a hoya does NOT like to be dead headed so never remove the dead flowers.
Hoya plant pests: Mealy bugs, spider mites, and aphids can be a problem. Spray the entire plant, reaching every little twisted section if possible, with the nontoxic “Green Solution” that is very effective against all types of houseplant pests. Read instructions on how to make the Green Solution in the Glossary of the website.
Hoya plant diseases: The main diseases to keep an eye out for are botrytis, a fungus that causes grayish areas on the leaves, and crown, stem; and root rot, a fungal disease caused by humid warm conditions, wet leaves, soggy soil, and poor air circulation.
Best soil for a hoya plant: Use a well-aerated fast-draining potting soil. Add a little sand to the soil if it seems too heavy and is not drying out quickly.
Pot size for a hoya plant: Keep the plant in a small pot that has drip holes in the bottom to prevent over-watering.
How to prune a hoya plant: Never cut off the old stems since this is where the new flowers develop. Never cut off the dead flowers.
Hoya plants are easy to propagate using stem tip cuttings from the new vines. Read more about propagation using stem tip cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Hoya plants rest during the winter months and require even less water than usual.
Although not considered poisonous, hoya plants may make dogs and cats ill if they eat a large number of the leaves.
Indoors, hoya plants need to be about 3 years old and sit in very bright light in order to bloom. Never cut off the older stems because that is where the flowers will grow.
Not a good idea!! New flowers develop on the old flower stems of a hoya plant so never cut off the old stems.
You can try to get rid of Mealy Bugs on hoya plants by spraying the entire plant with the ” green solution” (8oz. water & 8oz. alcohol, add two tablespoons of biodegradable soap and two tablespoons of mineral oil). You can read more about this simple remedy in the Glossary of the website. You can also purchase a very small pesticide bomb at your local nursery. Place your plant in a plastic bag, release the bomb, and seal the plastic bag. Leave your Hoya in the bag for 24 hours. I prefer the ” green solution” since it doesn’t use chemicals."
134,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Dracaena Warnekii,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/dracaena-warnekii-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"Dracaena warnekii, like all dracaenas, are hardy, slow-growing plants that thrive on neglect. Sometimes referred to as a “striped dracaena”, the warnekii has long, pointed, narrow green and white striped leaves and can be used as a table plant, bushy floor plant, or tall cane plant for home and office. The “jumbo” variety has wider leaves and is a more compact plant. The “lemon lime” cultivar has yellow and green stripes. A dracaena warnekii is one of the few colorful indoor plants that can survive in low light conditions. NASA recommends the dracaena warnekii as a clean air plant, one of the top ten plants for removing formaldehyde from the air. Dracaena plants are considered to be slightly poisonous, especially to dogs and cats. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
A Dracaena warnekii survives in low light, but grows faster and fuller in medium light. In low light, the new leaves may be smaller and narrower. Direct sun burns the leaves.
All dracaena plants like to be kept on the dry side. Water well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Never allow the plant to sit in water. The lower the light level the less water a dracaena warnekii needs. All types of dracaenas are very sensitive to fluorine and chlorine. If your household water is heavily chlorinated or contains a great deal of fluoride, allow it to sit out over night before using it; use water from an outside hose; use rain water or distilled water. Never use water that has passed through a water softener. It is too salty and can damage the leaves.
Dracaena plants do not require much fertilizer. Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. It’s not necessary to feed dracaenas in the fall or winter.
Usual household temperatures between 65°- 80°F (18.3°-26.7°C). are fine for a Dracaena Warnekii. Keep the leaves of striped dracaenas away from cold windows, air conditioners, and heaters.
Dracaena plants prefer high humidity but do well in basic household humidity.
Although dracaenas can bloom, they rarely flower as potted plants.
Mealy bugs and spider mites
Fluoride toxicity causes brown leaf tips and long tan/brown streaks in the white stripes of the leaves. Over watering causes root rot. Fusarium Leaf Spot Disease causes reddish tan spots with wide, yellow halos on a Dracaena Warnekii.
Use a fast-draining well-aerated loose soil. Dracaena plants can even be grown in soil mixed with lava rock.
These plants like to be root-bound in a small pot. When the roots have filled the existing pot, it is time to move your dracaena warnekii to the next size container. Be sure any pot you use has drip holes in the bottom.
Brown leaf tips can be cut off the leaves with a wet scissors. Tall stalks with only a few leaves at the top can be cut anywhere along the stalk. New growth appears all along the stem below the cut area.
A Dracaena warnekii is propagated by stem (cane) cuttings.
NASA recommends a dracaena warnekii as a clean air plant.
Dracaena warnekii plants have a level #1 toxicity and are considered slightly poisonous especially to dogs and cats.
Cane plants such as a Dracaena Warnekii or Striped Dracaena naturally lose their bottom leaves. As long as new leaves are developing at the top of the Dracaena plant canes, there’s no need to worry about bottom leaves falling off.
Leaves of a Dracaena Warnekii HousePlants, or the Striped Dracaena Plant, get blotchy and have a reddish haze when they are being attacked by a houseplant pest called spider mites. Spray your Dracaena HousePlants with the green solution (recipe in the Glossary) every 10 days for a month.
Dark brown tips on the leaves of a Dracaena warnekii can be a sign of over- watering, too much fluoride in the water, too much fertilizer, or severe under-watering. Let at least 50% of the soil in your Striped Dracaena dry out before watering, fertilize monthly in the spring and summer and never in the fall and winter, and use water that does not have fluoride in it.
If your Dracaena Plant only has leaves at the top of the stalks and nothing the rest of the way down to the soil line, cut the canes back to where you would like them to branch out. All Dracaena Plants will start to send out several new stems from below the cut area very quickly. You can plant the tops of the Striped Dracaena stalks you cut off in the same pot or start a new plant; leave only 6” or less of stem connected to the sections you are planting."
135,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Zebra Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/zebra-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A  Zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa) has spectacular foliage and exotic looking flowers. The nickname Zebra plant comes from its large, dark green, shiny leaves that have a bold white midrib and white veins. The stems of the leaves have a purple tinge. The bright yellow flowers on a Zebra plant, which require very bright light to bloom, emerge from bracts at the end of a long stem. A Zebra plant, native to the Brazilian forests, is primarily a table plant that stands about a foot tall.  These plants do require a little extra care; but this beautiful, out of the ordinary houseplant, is well worth it.
Zebra plants require very bright indirect light but no direct sun, especially if you want them to bloom.
Keep the soil moist but not soggy, and never allow the soil to totally dry out. Bottom leaves drop off a Zebra plant when it is over or under -watered.
Feed a Zebra plant weekly in the spring and summer with a basic houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Zebra plants prefer temperatures between 65°-75°F (18.3°-23.9°C). Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 60°F (15.6°C) causes leaves to fall off.
Zebra plants, native to the jungles of Brazil, like very high humidity. If necessary, place your Zebra plant on a tray of wet pebbles to help increase the moisture in the air around it. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
A Zebra plant produces flowers from a four sided yellow spike made up of overlapping bracts. The yellow flowers only last a few days, but the attractive bracts of a Zebra plant last for a month or two. Once the bright yellow bract fades, remove the entire flower spike.
Though somewhat pest resistant, whitefly, mealy bugs, aphids, scale, and spider mites can all be a problem. These houseplants pests can all be treated with the Green Solution, but avoid spraying the flowers.
The high humidity a Zebra plant prefers encourages fungal leaf spot disease. You can prevent this problem by keeping the leaves dry and providing good air circulation.
Zebra plants grow well in a fast- draining, highly organic potting soil such as an African Violet mix.
Zebra plants are usually found in 6″ pots.
Zebra Plants enjoy being trimmed, but wait until the plant has stopped blooming.
Propagate a zebra plant using stem tip cuttings
When the flower, really the bright yellow bract, on your Zebra plant fades completely, remove the entire spike it was growing on. Allow your plant to rest for a month or so by moving it to a cooler location and giving it less water; then move your plant back to its bright, warmer location.
Zebra plants are non-poisonous.
A Zebra plant produces flowers from a four sided yellow spike made up of overlapping bracts. The yellow flowers only last a few days, but the attractive bracts of a Zebra plant last for a month or two. Once the bright yellow bract fades, remove the entire flower spike.
The brown spots of the leaves of zebra plants are usually caused by Leaf Spot Disease. Keep the leaves dry, do not mist the plant, provide good air circulation, and allow the leaves to dry out more. You can use a commercial Fungicide or treat the problem with the homemade remedy of putting a tablespoon or two of baking soda and a teaspoon or two of mineral oil in a spray bottle of water. Shake the solution well and then spray all areas of the plant that are infected. Keep infected plants away from your other houseplants.
Zebra plants are called “photo accumulators.” In order for a Zebra plant to get flowers they have to have the right number of long days in bright light. Move your Zebra plant to a brighter location and hopefully it will bloom in the fall."
136,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Donkey’s Tail Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/donkeys-tail-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Donkey’s Tail plant (Sedum Morganianum), sometimes called a Burro’s Tail Sedum, Donkey Tail Cactus , or Lamb’s Tail, is an easy-care succulent plant native to southern Mexico and Honduras. It is part of the Crassulaceae (Stonecrop) family and a relative of the jade plant and the kalanchoe. A Donkey’s Tail plant is very fragile and the small, swollen leaves easily fall off if the plant is disturbed. The good news is that these leaves root quickly and easily to produce new plants. The plant does best in a hanging basket where the stems have lots of room to cascade down and  no one can bump into it. Like most succulent plants, a Donkey’s Tail plant grows well both as an outside and indoor plant if you provide plenty of very bright light and protect the plant from temperatures below 40°F (4.4C)
This very attractive and unique looking plant has long 2-3ft  (60cm – 91.4 cm) trailing stems covered in plump, tear drop shaped, blue-green leaves that overlap like the hairs on an animal’s tail.  The stems look almost braided since  the leaves surround them completely. When the soil is very dry, the leaves may flatten out and become wrinkled. The stems start out growing upright, but eventually drape down as they become heavy with water filled leaves. During the summer, a mature Donkey’s Tail plant sometimes produces small, star-shaped, pink, red,white, or yellow flowers  in terminal clusters at the ends of the stems. Baby Burro plant or the “Burrito” plant, sometimes referred to as a hybrid or a cultivar of the Donkey’s tail plant, has shorter leaves and stems, and smaller, rounder, lime green leaves.s
Very bright light and some direct sun
Over watering is the reason main reason the plant dies
Feed in spring and summer only
Donkey Tail’s plant likes warm temperatures 65°-75°F (18.3°-23.9°C)
Keep the plant root-bound in a small pot
Propagate using stem and leaf cuttings
Cool temperatures, 50°-60°F (10°-15.6°C)  in winter, help the plant flower in summer
Easily propagated using leaf and stem cuttings
Leaves far apart on stem – plant needs more bright light
Leaves falling off  – plant is over watered
Yellow bleached leaves – plant is getting too much direct sun
Wilting or soft leaves – soil is staying wet too long
A Donkey’s Tail plant is a perfect plant for someone who wants a unique looking hanging plant that requires very little care. Be careful not to confuse it with Creeping Spurge or Myrtle Spurge which are sometimes incorrectly referred to as Donkey’s Tail plant. Myrtle Spurge is a poisonous plant and should be kept it away from small children and pets.  A Donkey’s Tail plant is non- toxic and safe to have around children and pets.
A Donkey’s Tail plant needs at least four hours of sun or very bright light every day. In low light, the new growth is small, pale, and weak.
Succulent plants need to dry out before you water, and a Donkey’s Tail plant is no exception. Water well and then don’t water again until the soil has almost completely dried out. Over-watering a Donkey’s Tail plant or any succulent plant is the easiest way to kill it. The leaves of the plant become flat and even a little wrinkled when it needs water. Keep the soil even drier in the winter when the plant is dormant.
Feed monthly from March through September, diluting the plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never fertilize a Donkey’s Tail plant during the winter when the plant is resting.
A Donkey’s Tail plant grows best when the temperature is between 65°-75°F (18.3°-23.9°C). During the winter, when the plant is dormant, lower the temperature by 10°, keep the plant out of drafts, and away from cold doors & windows.
Basic household humidity enough to keep the plant leaves looking healthy.
When allowed to rest in a cool area during the winter, a Donkey’s Tail plant may produce star- shaped flowers in pink, red, white or yellow during the summer.
Mealy bugs are the main plant pest to look out for. You can read how to identify and treat mealy bugs in the Glossary of the website.
The main and most serious plant disease that can kill a Donkey’s Tail plant is root-rot due to over watering.
Use a loose and fast draining soil for a Donkey’s tail plant. A cactus or succulent mix is a good choice.
Do not rush to move the plant to a larger pot. A Donkey’s Tail plant like to be root-bound.
If the leaves on a stem fall off or are knocked off, it’s a good idea to remove the entire stem.
A Donkey’s Tail plant is easily propagated using leaf or stem cuttings. Read more about how to propagate houseplants in the Glossary of the website.
Move a Donkey’s Tail plant to a cool, low light area and keep the soil dry during the winter the winter when it’s resting.
Donkey’s Tail plant is the common name for Sedum Morganianum and is a non-poisonous houseplant.
Here are a few suggestions for how to get a Donkey’s Tail plant to flower, although I can’t promise they will work. Hang your Donkey’s Tail plant in a very bright location where the temperature is between 65°-75° in the spring, summer, & fall. During the winter, allow the Donkey’s Tail plant to rest in a cooler location, give it less water than you usually would, and don’t fertilize at all. In the spring start your usual care routine again. Be patient!
The white, sticky, cottony looking things on your Donkey’s Tail Plant is Mealy Bugs. Your Donkey’s Tail Plant needs to be sprayed with the “ green solution.” The entire plant needs to be sprayed including all sides of the leaves. Move the leaves gently and carefully when you spray, because the leaves of a Donkey’s Tail Plant fall off very easily when moved around.
Yes and no. There is a Lamb’s Tail plant with the scientific name Umbilicus oppositifolius which is totally different from the Sedum Morganianum we are talking about. That said, Donkey’s Tail plant has picked up several nicknames including Lamb’s Tail plant, Burro’s Tail plant, and Horse’s Tail plant.
The leaves on the stem of your Donkey’s Tail plant are getting farther apart because the plant is not getting enough bright light. A Donkey’s Tail plant needs to be near very bright or direct morning sun for a large part of the day. Donkey’s Tail plants do not do well in lower light.
Your Mom is thinking of Euphorbia myrsinites (creeping splurge) sometimes mistakenly called a Donkey’s Tail Plant. Creeping Splurge is highly toxic, Donkey’s Tail Plant is a non- poisonous houseplant."
137,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Parlor Palm,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/parlor-palm-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,," Chamadorea elegans (Neanthe bella or Neanthe palm) is part of the Arecaceae family. Its common name, and one most of us recognize, is  Parlor Palm.  One of the reasons a Parlor palm is one of the most popular indoor palms grown and sold, is that it thrives in almost any location. Like its relative the Kentia Palm, this plant can even stay healthy in low light. Parlor Palm’s popularity as a houseplant dates back to Victorian times when it was a favorite plant used in the “parlours” of well to do families.
A Parlor Palm, which was originally discovered growing in the rainforests of Guatemala and Southern Mexico, is the most popular indoor palm sold. It is a type of “feather palm;” other familiar feather palms are the kentia palm, the pygmy date palm, the coconut palm, and the sentry palm. A Parlor Palm can be small enough to place in a terrarium, perfect to sit on a table or desk, or as a mature plant, tall enough to be an elegant floor plant. This is a compact, bushy plant with dark green, long, graceful fronds. The fronds have a middle rib with soft, drooping leaflets coming off each side. When planted in a 10” pot, a parlor palm can grow 3-4ft. tall in three or four years and sometimes produce very small, ball like yellow flowers. Since these palms require very little care, it is the perfect plant for offices, businesses, and any area that might have less than optimal growing conditions.  Indoor palms, whether it’s an Areca Palm, a Bamboo Palm, a Kentia Palm, or a Cat Palm, come in all sizes and shapes, but they all have one very important thing in common. The only growing point on a palm is at the very end of each stem. If you cut off this growing tip, you will kill the entire the stem.
Brown fronds can be caused by over watering, severe under watering, too much fertilizer, using water from a softener or water high in chlorine and fluorine.
Yellow fronds are usually the result of underwatering
Brown spots on fronds is a sign of leaf spot disease, cold temperatures , or over watering
Warm temperatures above 50°F (10°C)
Medium light and no direct sun
Allow the soil to partially dry out before watering and never allow a parlor palm to sit in water
Propagation is very difficult
Although an indoor Parlor Palm, unlike one grown outdoors, rarely produces any flowers, the feathery, lush fronds make it a beautiful houseplant. Some added pluses; a Parlor Palm cleans the air of harmful pollutants and it is safe to have around cats, dogs, and children. Follow the simple care tips below and you’ll have a lovely plant for many, many years.
How much light for a Parlor Palm: This particular palm can grow slowly in low light, but prefers medium, indirect light. Avoid putting any indoor palm plant in direct sun.
How to water a Parlor Palm: Water well, and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. The roots of a parlor palm should never totally dry out. Water less during the winter when the plant is not actively growing. Brown leaf tips often indicate over watering, while yellow fronds tell you a Parlor Palm needs a bit more water.
How to fertilize a Parlor Palm: Feed monthly in the spring and summer with a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Do not feed a Parlor Palm in the fall and winter. Too much plant food causes “fertilizer burn” and brown tips on the fronds.
Best temperature for a Parlor Palm: Try to provides temperatures between 62°-82° F (16.7°-27.8°C). A Parlor Palm can briefly handle temperatures as low as 50°F (10°C) but will die in temperatures lower than 40°F (4.4°C). Avoid cold drafts.
Does a Parlor Palm need high humidity: High humidity definitely helps the plant grow faster and look better. When the air is too dry, leaf tips turn brown and spider mites become a problem.
Does an indoor Parlor Palm flower: As the plant matures, and under ideal growing conditions, a Parlor Palm sometimes produces stalks of small, inconsequential, yellow flowers followed by seeds. These seeds can’t be used to propagate a new plant since they are not fertile. I recommend cutting the flower stalk off as soon as it appears.
Parlor Palm Pests: Although scale and mealybugs can be a problem, it is spider mites that do the most damage. These annoying pests suck the color out of the fronds. The leaves of an indoor palm are very sensitive, so never use a commercial insecticide or any product containing alcohol. If spraying the plant with warm soapy water doesn’t solve the problem, use an insecticidal soap. Read more about spider mites, scale, and mealybugs in the Glossary of the website.
Parlor Palm diseases: Fungal and bacterial diseases such as leaf spot and root rot are a problem. These diseases occur when a parlor palm is over watered, has wet fronds due to misting, or there is poor circulation around the plant.
Best soil for a Parlor Palm: Use a basic, indoor potting soil that retains water but still drains quickly. Once the soil starts to break down and becomes heavy and water logged, immediately replace it with fresh soil.
What size pot for a Parlor Palm: These plants like to be a little root bound so don’t rush to move them into larger containers. When you do repot, the new pot should be only one size larger and have drip holes in the bottom. The roots of Parlor Palm are fragile and easily damaged, so be very careful when repotting.
How to prune a Parlor Palm: Prune dead or damaged fronds but never the stems. A Parlor Palm grows from a terminal bud at the end of the stem. Cutting off a terminal bud causes the stem to stop growing and may even cause the plant to die. Remove brown or yellow fronds a soon as they appear.
How to propagate a Parlor Palm: Successful propagation is usually done by seeds. This is a very difficult process best left to the experts. If you want to try your hand at propagating a Parlor Palm, try using the small offsets that grow horizontally off the root ball of the plant. Read more about how to propagate a plant using offsets in the propagation section of the website Glossary.
Does a Parlor Palm clean the air: It is recommended as a “clean air plant” that removes harmful chemicals from the air.
A Parlor Palm in a non-poisonous houseplant and is not toxic to cats, dogs, or children.
The fine webbing on your Parlor Palm indicates the plant has Spider Mites. To get rid of Spider Mite houseplant pests, spray you entire palm with warm soapy water every 10 days for a month. If that doesn’t solve the problem, use an insecticidel soap. Palm leaves are sensitive never use anything, such as the ” green solution“, that contains alcohol.
Your Parlor Palm is turning yellow because you are allowing the soil to get too dry. Try giving your plant a little more water and I think your yellow frond problem will go away.
The white “sticky stuff” on your parlor palm leaves is a houseplant pest called Mealy Bugs. Dip a Q Tip in alcohol and carefully dab the white stuff off, then spray your entire Parlor Palm with warm soapy water. Be sure to spray inside the new growth and reach inside the stem coverings. If this doesn’t get rid of the Mealy Bug infestation after three treatments, 10 days apart, use a commercial insecticidal soap.
Brown tips on the ends of houseplant Palm fronds (leaves) are usually the result of too much water, too much plant food, too many chemicals in the water you are using, or using water that has passed through a water softener."
138,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Baby’s Tears Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/babys-tears-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Baby’s Tears plant, Helxine soleirolii, is native to Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, and throughout the northern Mediterranean area. For a very small plant, it has a great many common names: Bits and Pieces plant, Corsican Creeper, Peace in the Home plant, Friendship plant, Mind-Your-Own-Business plant, and Paddy’s Wig. It is also referred to as Irish moss; however, a Baby’s Tears plant is a type of nettle and not a type of moss at all.
A Baby’s Tears plant was used as a mossy ground cover long before it became a houseplant. Outdoors, it grows close to the ground in a creeping  fashion, producing mounds of  small, green leaves and tiny white flowers. This very little plant spreads quickly when planted in a warm, shady spot out of the direct sun. Although it only grows about 2″-5″ tall, a Baby’s Tears plant can spread out over six feet and is often considered an invasive plant.
Indoors this delicate looking plant resembles a mat or carpet of tiny, green, round or bean-shaped leaves on fragile looking stems.  As the plant grows, it spreads over the surface and drops down the sides of its pot. When the stems are long enough, you can even put the plant in a small, hanging basket. The Baby Tears “Argentea”  (Helxine solerirolii argentea) has silvery leaves and the Dwarf  Baby’s Tears plant is often used as a terrarium plant.

As an indoor plant, a Baby’s Tears requires attention and is not very forgiving. If you want it to grow well it need:
Bright, indirect light but no sun
Barely moist soil but be careful not to over water
Minimum temperature 45°F (7.2C)
High Humidity
Heavy feeding in the spring and summer only
Use a loose soil that drains quickly
If your Baby’s Tears plant starts to decline, you can easily propagate  it by plant division or using stem cuttings from healthy parts of the plant.
Baby’s Tears plants like bright, indirect light but no direct sun.
Keep the soil of a Baby Tear’s plant moist but never soggy. If the soil stays too wet, the roots and stems die.
Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer when a Baby’s Tears plant is actively growing. Use a balanced fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.
Normal household temperatures or even a little cooler are best, 60°-75°F (15.6°-23.9°C) is ideal.
High humidity and good air circulation help a Baby’s Tears plant to grow well and prevents brown leaves.
A Baby’s Tears plant gets tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in the late spring.
Baby’s Tears plants are susceptible to whitefly, scale, and aphids. You can read about these plant pests in the Glossary of the website.
Root-rot, due to over-watering, is the main disease to that affects this plant.
Baby’s Tears plants require a well-aerated, quick draining, potting soil that contains a good amount of peat moss.
These are small plants and are usually are found in 4″ or 6″ pots.
Trim a Baby’s Tears plant with a sharp scissors to maintain its shape and fullness.
Propagate by plant division and stem cuttings. You can read more about these propagation techniques in the Glossary of the website.
A Baby’s Tears plant is non-poisonous and looks perfect in a child’s room.
A Baby Tear’s Plant is a great terrarium plant, sometimes even too good. If you’re not careful it will rapidly overtake everything else in the terrarium.
Baby’s Tears plants do get very tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in the late spring. The flowers are pretty inconsequential.
A Baby Tear’s plant does very well outside in shady, rock gardens, spreading like a fluffy green carpet. They are frost sensitive and will die back in the winter. Baby’s Tears plants should be kept moist whether growing inside and outside."
139,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/14,Zamioculcas Zamiifolia-ZZ Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/zz-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A ZZ plant, Zamioculcas zamiifolia, has many names around the world: Eternity Plant, Emerald Palm, Zanzibar Gem, ZuZu Plant, and Aroid Palm. It was originally found growing as an outdoor, flowering plant in eastern Africa but can now be found growing in tropical areas around the world. It was a Dutch nursery in Africa that realized a ZZ plant would be a perfect houseplant and started to propagate and sell it world wide. A ZZ plant is a member of the Araceae family and a close relative of the dieffenbachia, anthurium, philodendron monstera, and caladium.
The unique looking, almost impossible to kill  ZZ plant, is a slow growing, upright succulent plant that burst onto the houseplant market in the 1990’s. It became an immediate hit with indoor plant lovers because it grew almost anywhere and was tolerant of all types of care, except being over watered. What we call the the stems of a ZZ plant really the leaves of the plant. These long, thick “stems,” 15″-20″ tall (   ) are covered in hundreds of small, plump, shiny green, leathery leaflets (not leaves) that are about 2″-3″ long. During the summer and early fall the plant may produce small flowers hidden inside a 2″-3″ dark yellow or bronze colored spadex; flowering usually occurs when a ZZ plant is grown outdoors. The roots of the plant are fat rhizomes, underground horizontal stems, that store water and enable a ZZ plant to be drought resistant. In a lowlight, cool area, a ZZ plant can sometimes go three or four months without being watered; it simply uses the water that has been stored in the rhizomes to survive.ZZ Plant Varieties
ZZ plants are more expensive than common houseplants like a pothos or dieffenbachia because they are slow growers and it takes more time for them to grow large enough to be sold commercially. A variegated ZZ plant needs more light than the solid green variety. Direct sunlight can easily damage the leaves on all ZZ plants.
Regular ZZ plant has medium, dark green, shiny, plump leaves and tall thick stems with a swollen base. 
“White Variegated” ZZ plant has green and white, shiny leaves and tall thick stems with a swollen base. 
“Gold Variegated” ZZ plant has a mixture of leaves that can be solid green, solid yellow, or a green and yellow mix, and tall thick stems with a swollen base. 
“Raven” ZZ plant has bright green leaves when first grown; but, as the plant matures, the leaves turn a very dark greenish black color.
“Lucky” ZZ plant is more compact with leaflets that are flatter and rounder.
Zenzi (“Dwarf Zenzi”) is a smaller, shorter, denser variety with the dark green leaflets growing closer together.

ZZ plant stores water in thick rhizomes so it very drought resistant. Over watering is the main reason a ZZ plant dies
Direct sun damages the leaves
Too much plant food causes yellow leaf burn
This is a very poisonous plant so wear gloves and long sleeves when propagating or pruning.
The ZZ plant may be one of the hardiest and most forgiving indoor plants I can recommend; just try not to kill it with kindness! Although a ZZ plant has also been shown by NASA to remove toxic pollutants such xylene and benzene  from the air and is considered a “clean air” plant, it is also a very poisonous plant and extremely toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets. Small children are often attracted to the plump, bright green leaves, so keep your ZZ plant well out of reach. Read more about common houseplants that are poisonous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
How much light does a ZZ plant need: These plants can survive in low light, but grow faster in bright, indirect light. Since a ZZ plant is a slow grower even in good light, in low light they rarely produces new leaves. Direct sun will fade and burn the leaves. Stems on a ZZ plant droop when there is not enough light and grow straight up when light is coming from above.
How to water a ZZ plant: Over-watering is the main (and practically the only) way to kill a ZZ plant. This is a plant that stores water in its rhizomes and does do not like wet feet, so allow the soil to dry out before watering. Unlike most plants, a ZZ plant is very forgiving, allowing you to over-water a few times before showing signs of serious damage. Yellow leaves are an indication that the plant has been over-watered or severely under-watered. In very warm weather, a ZZ plant may need water every 7-10 days. In cooler weather, the soil may take 2-3 weeks to dry out. When you water, water well enough so the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Do not allow the plant to sit in the excess water.
How to fertilize a ZZ plant: Feed monthly when the plant is actively producing new leaves and every other month when it is not in a growing phase. Use a balanced, liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Too much plant food causes yellow leaves due to “nutrient burn”.
Best temperature for a ZZ plant: Temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C) are best. When the temperatures is below 60°F (16.6°C), the cold air slows down the plant growth.
Humidity for a ZZ plant: ZZ plants grow well in basic household humidity.
Does a ZZ plant flower: A ZZ plant can produce little white, spathe-type flowers similar to the ones you see on a Peace Lily, but this very rarely happens when the plant is grown indoors.
ZZ plant plant pests: A ZZ plant is very pest resistant.
ZZ plant plant diseases: ZZ plants are also resistant to most plant plant diseases, but quite susceptible to root-rot due to over watering.
Soil for a ZZ plant: Use a well-aerated soil that retains water but still drains quickly. Add sand to the potting mixture if the soil becomes too heavy and compact.
Pot size for a ZZ plant: ZZ plants grow very slowly and need a new container about every two or three years. The new pot should be only one size larger and must have drip holes in the bottom. The best time to re-pot a ZZ plant is during the spring or early summer.
How to prune a a ZZ plant: Prune yellow leaves and bare stems as soon as they develop.
How to propagate a ZZ plant: The best best propagation method is to use stem or leaf cuttings. Be patient, it may take several months before you see any new growth on the cuttings. Read exactly how to propagate a plant using leaf and stem cuttings in the Glossary of the website.
Is a ZZ plant poisonous: This is an extremely poisonous plant and very toxic to cats and dogs. Keep the plant out of the reach of small children who are tempted by the plump shiny leaves. A ZZ plant has a #4 toxicity level, the very highest level.
The new growth on your ZZ plant may be turning brown and not opening because it is getting too much light, too much fertilizer, or too little humidity. The ends of the stems of your ZZ plant may be getting sunburned if the plant is in direct sunlight. Too much fertilizer causes salts to build up in the soil and this injures the ZZ plant leaves. If the air is extremely dry, ZZ plant leaves develop brown edges.
Yellow leaves are an indication that the plant has been over-watered or severely under-watered. water meters are not always reliable. If there is a lot of salt in the soil from too much plant food or if you are using water that has passed through a water softener (too salty) then a water meter is unreliable. In very warm weather, a ZZ plant may need water every 7-10 days. In cooler weather, the plant may be able to go 2-3 weeks before needing water. When you do water, water well enough so that the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot. Do not allow the plant to sit in the excess water in the saucer for more than 10 minutes. Yellow leaves can also be the result of nutrient burn. ZZ plants do not need much plant food. Feed monthly when actively grow and every other month the rest of the time. Always dilute your balanced, liquid plant food to 1/2 the recommended strength.
You should never fertilize a houseplant that is not actively growing. I think moving your ZZ plant to a brighter location might encourgae new growth. Do not rush to move it to a larger container. These plants produce more leaves when root-bound."
140,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/15,Shamrock Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/shamrock-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Shamrock plant is a member of the Oxalis genus, and part of the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae. It appears in flower shops around St. Patrick’s Day. These plants got the nickname “Shamrock Plant” because their thin, triangular leaflets resemble a lucky clover plant. The name “shamrock” comes from the Irish word seamróg which means “young clover.” There are several stories associated with the Shamrock plant. One of the most popular is that St. Patrick, Ireland’s patron saint and the person credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland, plucked a Shamrock plant from the grass and used it to explain the Holy Trinity to his congregation. The three leaves, he said, represented the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. St. Patrick’s Day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death. The Shamrock plant is also credited with the arrival of spring and as a symbol for the “season of rebirth.
A Shamrock plant is a small, bulb plant approximately 5”-7” tall. The thin leaves are usually divided into three leaflets, though some varieties may have four or more leaflets, and resemble clover. The leaflets exhibit “sleep movements” which means they spread open in the light and close up when it gets dark. When placed in bright, indirect light, Shamrock plants produce delicate, colorful flowers.
Oxalis regnelli, the green leafed Shamrock plant, produces small, white flowers in late spring and summer.
Oxalis triangularis (Purple Shamrock or False Shamrock) has dark purple, triangular shaped leaves and pinkish/lavender flowers.
Oxalis versicolor (Candy Cane Oxalis) produces white, trumpet shaped flowers with red petal edges in early spring.
Oxalis tetraphylla (Iron Cross Oxalis or Good Luck Plant) has four heart shaped leaflets per leaf. The base of each leaflet is dark purple, making the leaf look like it has a beautiful cross at its center. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, dark pink flowers during the summer and fall.
Oxalis adenophylla (Silver Shamrock) has gray green leaves divided into heart shaped leaflets. It produces white flowers with lilac veins and lilac tips.

A Shamrock plant is easy to care for and adds a touch of spring to your home. However, these are perennial bulb plants and the leaves start to die back after the flowers fade. Don’t throw the plant out; Shamrock plants just need a little rest before starting to grow again. Follow the detailed instructions in the Resting Period part of the Care Section below and you’ll be able to enjoy your plant for many years. These plants are considered slightly poisonous if eaten in large quantities and should be kept away from pets and children. Read more about common houseplants that can be dangerous in my book Don’t Feed Me to Your Cat: A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants.
Shamrock plants need bright indirect light to grow well and produce flowers. They often bloom all winter if kept in a well-lit spot. The leaves of a Shamrock plant fold up at night and re-open when light returns.
Keep the soil barely moist but never soggy and allow the top 2” of soil to dry out before watering. It’s best to water a shamrock plant from the bottom so the thin fragile stems of the plant don’t get water logged and the soil stays loose.
Feed monthly in the spring and summer when a shamrock plant is actively growing with a balanced fertilizer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never feed a shamrock plant when it is dormant and the bulbs are resting.
Shamrock plants grow best in cool temperatures between 60°-70°F (15.6°-21.1°C) during the day and 55°-65°F (12.8°-18.3°C) at night.
Shamrock plants do well in basic household humidity.
The shamrock plant variety oxalis regnelli has small, delicate, white flowers. The shamrock variety oxalis triangularis has delicate little lavender flowers.
Shamrock plants attract aphids, whiteflies, and spiders mites. Use the “green solution,” a mixture of ½ mild soapy water, ½ alcohol and a few tablespoons of mineral oil to get rid of the spider mites and aphids. Yellow Sticky Insect cards is the best way to handle whiteflies.
Fungal rust (brownish/orange discoloration on the backs of leaves) and chlorotic ring spot (yellow rings on the tops of leaves) are the two main diseases to watch out for. In both instances, take the plant out of the pot, scrub the pot with a mild bleach mixture, and then wash it well before repotting the plant in fresh soil. Spray the plant with Neem Oil.
Use a loose and sandy soil rather than a rich and organic soil.
Keep shamrock plants in small pots to prevent over- watering.
If your shamrock plant gets thin and leggy, cut the plant back to an inch or two above the soil line and place it in very bright indirect light. Elongated stems occur because the plant is reaching for the light.
The best time to propagate a shamrock plant is in the early spring right after its dormant stage. Shamrock plants are propagated by bulb division. These plants have very small bulbs that are referred to as bulblets. The healthy bulbs are small, white, and puffy.
After a shamrock plant blooms, the leaves turn yellow, droop, and need to be removed; this usually occurs in the late fall. While it looks like the plant is dying, your shamrock plant is really starting its resting or dormant phase. After all of the leaves have died, stop watering and move your plant to a cool, low- light area. Green shamrock plants need to rest for 2-3 months while purple shamrock plants need only about a month. After your plant has rested for the appropriate amount of time, move it back into bright, indirect light and water as usual. Once new growth appears, fertilize with a balanced houseplant food diluted to ½ the recommended strength. Shamrock plants may go dormant several times a year.
Shamrock plants are very popular gifts for St. Patrick’s Day and Easter.
Shamrock plants are slightly poisonous if eaten in very large quantities with a #1 toxicity level.
To help a shamrock plant become fuller and bushier, move the plant to a location that gets more light and be sure the temperature stays on the cool side.
The soil your shamrock is planted in may be too rich in organic matter and not sandy enough. Rich soil helps with leaf growth but impairs flower growth. You can also try stressing the plant by letting it dry out a little more before watering it. This often helps it to flower.
The best time to propagate a shamrock plant is right after its dormant stage when you are about to return it to its normal bright location and start watering again. Separate the Shamrock Plant Bulbs and plant them in slightly sandy soil.
Yellow leaves on a shamrock plant indicate over watering. Try allowing the soil of your shamrock plant to dry out more before you water."
141,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/page/15,Hawaiian Ti Plant,https://www.houseplant411.com/houseplant/hawaiian-ti-plant-how-to-grow-care-guide/,,,"A Hawaiian Ti plant, Cordyline fruticosa, is in the family Asparagaceae. It is a relative of the Agave, Sansevieria, and Yucca.  Although many plant sources still refer to the plant as Cordyline terminalis, that name is now considered invalid by the International Cordyline Society. Other common names for a Hawaiian Ti plant are, Ti Plant, Good Luck Plant, and Hawaiian Good Luck plant. Many types of cordylines are native to Hawaii, but other varieties were also found in Australia, New Zealand, South America, and parts of Asia. The long leaves of a Hawaiian Ti plant are often used as roofing material and to make traditional “hula” skirts.
A Hawaiian Ti plant is one of the most colorful foliage plants you can purchase. The cane-like woody stems produce sword-shaped leaves 2ft.-5ft. in length and 5″ to 7″ in width. Leaf color can be a solid color or a mixture of maroon, purple, rose, yellow, cream, white, pink, green, or just plant solid green. When young, a Hawaiian Ti plant is a small table plant, as it matures, it becomes an exotic looking floor plant.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Black Mystique’ has leaves that start out green and become almost purple/black.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Sherbert’ has green leaves with stripes of pink, cream, and magenta.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Florida Red’ has narrower leaves that are dark reddish/purple with lighter pinkish/red highlights.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Hawaiian Boy’ has dark reddish/purple leaves.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Maria’ has magenta leaves at first that then get bright pink tips and striations pink.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Morning Sunshine’ Has brightly colored leaves in light yellow, pink, orange, and green.
Cordyline fruticosa ‘Ruby’ has, depending on the light, deep burgundy, magenta, pink, and green leaves

Bright, indirect light but no direct sun
Keep the soil barely moist and never allow the soil to totally dry out
Provide warm temperatures 65°-85°F (18.3°-29.4°C)
High humidity helps the plant look better
Feed only in the spring and summer and never use a plant food containing fluoride
Propagate by plant division or by using plant cuttings
There are many similarities between a Hawaiian Ti plant and a dracaena. The major difference is that dracaenas are easy- care plants while Hawaiian Ti plants require a bit of extra care to grow well. They are a colorful, exotic looking addition for any bright area in your home.  Ti plants are considered poisonous, so please keep them away from pets and children. Read more about common plants that are poisonous in Don’t Feed Me To Your Cat! A Guide to Poisonous Houseplants
A Hawaiian Ti plant grows well in bright, indirect light; avoid direct sun or the leaves will burn. If the light is too low the beautiful purple, red, pink, magenta, orange, cream, and yellow leaves revert to green.
Proper watering is the most difficult part of taking care of a Ti plant. The soil should be moist but never soggy, and should never totally dry out. If your household water contains fluorine, chlorine, or passes through a water softener, use distilled water or allow your regular water to sit out over night before using it. Chemicals in the water damage the leaves of a Hawaiian Ti plant. Fluoride toxicity is especially harmful, causing ugly brown leaf tips.
Feed a Hawaiian Ti plant monthly in the spring and summer with a liquid or slow release plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Never use a fertilizer that contains fluoride.
Ti plants prefer warm temperatures between 65°-85°F (18.3°-29.4°C). Be careful to keep a Hawaiian Ti plant away from drafts and heating vents.
High humidity is necessary to keep the leaves of a Hawaiian Ti plant looking good. If the air in you home is very dry, place a small humidifier nearby or set your Ti plant on a wet pebble tray. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water.
Ti plants attract fungus gnats, mealy bugs, spider mites, scale, and thrip. A bad infestation of spider mites is often the cause of faded looking leaves. Spray frequently with a mild soapy water solution and keep the leaves dust- free to help prevent both plant pests and plant diseases.
A Hawaiian Ti plant prefers high humidity, which encourages fungal and bacterial plant diseases such as Leaf Spot and Erwinia Blight.
Use a loose, well-aerated fast-draining potting soil.
Re-pot in the spring if the roots have filled the existing container. When moving a Ti plant to a bigger pot, use one that is only one size larger than the current pot and be sure it has drainage holes in the bottom.
Prune brown, yellow, or damaged leaves with a clean, sharp scissors that has been dipped in alcohol to prevent spreading any plant diseases.
Propagate using cane cuttings, stem cuttings, or plant division. If the stalks are thick enough, you can even try air layering. Read about all of these propagation techniques in the Glossary.
A Ti plant cleans the air of harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene.
Ti plants are poisonous with a #2 toxicity level. They are especially dangerous to dogs and cats.
There could be a few things causing Ti plant leaf problems. Faded colors in the leaves can be the result of low light, too much fertilizer, bright direct sun, very warm temperatures, and spider mites. Examine both sides of the leaves of your Ti plant for spider mites; these plant pests suck the color from the leaves. Chemicals such as fluoride, chlorine, and salt in the water also cause leaf damage.
Your Ti plant is probably not doing well because now that it’s inside and gets less light and is in a cooler space, it needs less water and less fertilizer. Cut back on your water and plant food and I bet the plant starts to do better.
Ti plants, like dracaenas, are cane plants and it is normal for bottom leaves to drop off when new leaves appear at the top. If the leaf drop is excessive, try giving your plant a little more water. Also, turn your Ti plant every few weeks so all parts of the plant get the proper amount of light."
