    Cultivars/Varieties
    
'Compacta' - Similar to species, except only 3' tall. 
    
    
'Conti' (Confetti™) - A variegated sport reaching perhaps 2' tall 
  with a dense, compact habit. The leaves are margined white (pinkish in winter) 
  and it bears pure white flowers in summer. Early trials indicate that this plant 
  may lack vigor and fail in zones colder than 7.
'Dwarf Purple' - Features green leaves that turn purplish in autumn 
  and are retained in good quantity through winter. Blooms are pink and the habit 
  is low and dense, under 3' tall.
'Edward Goucher' - A hybrid cultivar (between A. x grandiflora 
  and A. schumannii) that is very popular in the trade. Flowers are deeper-colored 
  than A. x grandiflora and purple-pink. Leaves are less lustrous 
  and a lighter color green. Mature size is about 5' tall and wide, and the plant 
  blooms for a long period from June to frost. Less hardy than A. x grandiflora, 
  perhaps not the best choice for areas colder than zone 6.
'Francis Mason' - A form that has yellow-green leaves with a more intense 
  yellow margin. Leaves in winter can look somewhat unattractive due to their 
  color. New shoots emerge with a copper cast. A relatively heavy bloomer that 
  reaches up to 5 feet tall
'Little Richard' - A dwarf variety reaching 3' tall and wide. Growth 
  is dense and blooms are white.
'Sherwoodii' - Smaller in all its parts than the species, with a lower 
  habit (to 4' tall and wide) and smaller, finer-textured leaves. Leaves turn 
  purplish in winter.
'Sunrise' - The leaf margins are yellow and the center of the leaf is 
  dark green. Grows to at least 3 feet tall.","Habitat

'Candicans' - Notable for its intense silvery-blue needles, perhaps 
  the bluest of all Abies.
'Compacta' - A handsome dwarf form with an irregular habit and blue 
  needles.
'Dwarf Globe' - A dwarf form (to 3' tall) with needles that are borne 
  densely and bluish-green in color.
'Glenmore' - A more compact variety than the species with grey-blue 
  needles that are longer than usual.
'Gable's Weeping' - An unusual, slow-growing form that forms a mound 
  of drooping branches.
'Violacea' - Beautiful form with intense silvery-blue needles. Often 
  grafted on species understock.","

Cultivars/Varieties 

None are common in the trade, but several are occasionally seen.
Several have colored leaves, including 'Pulverentum' with variegated 
  foliage, 'Postelense' with leaves that emerge yellow and mature to green, 
  and 'Schwerinii' with new purple foliage that turns green.
Selections with variation in form are more common, with 'Compactum' (also 
  known as 'Nanum') assuming the proportions of an attractive dense shrub 
  only perhaps 6' tall.","

'Auratum' - A fine form with intense yellow leaves. Color may fade in

'Flamingo' - A highly promoted cultivar with mature leaves that resemble 
  'Variegatum'. The new growth, however, emerges bright pink for an interesting 
  effect in spring. This effect can be enhanced by pruning the plant to promote 
  vigorous shoot extensions.
'Kelly's Gold' - Another form with bright gold leaves often sold by 
  specialty catalogs. 
'Variegatum' - (Silver Leaf Boxelder) - A noteworthy small, variegated 
  tree. Leaves have a broad, white margin; fruits also variegated. Can throw a 
  green or totally white shoot on occasion, so prune these out. A female clone. 
  Best in zone 5 or warmer.

A complete discussion of the range of Acer palmatum cultivars is beyond 
  the scope of this forum, as hundreds exist. Listed below are some of the more 
  common cultivars. For more detailed listings, consult a reference book or specialty 
  catalog. 

var. atropurpureum - Leaves are reddish purple when they emerge, 
  but typically fade to green by July. Fall color is red. Less expensive to buy 
  than red foliage cultivars that retain red foliage throughout summer.
var. dissectum - Trees have leaves that are finely cut and incised. 
  Leaves have 7, 9 or 11 lobes. Texture is fine and leaves can appear threadlike. 

    
    
'Bloodgood'- has rosy foliage in early summer that darkens to burgundy 
  by mid-summer. Was selected because of its excellent color retention. A relatively 
  slow growing, upright to rounded form that reached 15' to 20'. Very commonly 
  grown and offered.
    
    'Butterfly' - A true variegated form with gray/green leaves featuring 
  a white/pink margin. A slow grower, only reaching 15' with age.

  catalog. 

var. atropurpureum - Leaves are reddish purple when they emerge, 
  but typically fade to green by July. Fall color is red. Less expensive to buy 
  than red foliage cultivars that retain red foliage throughout summer.
var. dissectum - Trees have leaves that are finely cut and incised. 
  Leaves have 7, 9 or 11 lobes. Texture is fine and leaves can appear threadlike. 

    
    
'Bloodgood'- has rosy foliage in early summer that darkens to burgundy 
  by mid-summer. Was selected because of its excellent color retention. A relatively 
  slow growing, upright to rounded form that reached 15' to 20'. Very commonly 
  grown and offered.
    
    'Butterfly' - A true variegated form with gray/green leaves featuring 
  a white/pink margin. A slow grower, only reaching 15' with age.
'Crimson Queen'- a red foliage form with dissected leaves and weeping 
  or arching branching. Slow growing, ultimately reaching 8' to 10' tall and 12' 
  wide.

   'Columnare', 'Erectum', 'Olmsted' - Some confusion exists as to
    the exact characteristics of these 3 cultivars. All are upright, columnar
    forms 10' to 20' wide and 40' to 60' tall. Generally comprised of a single
    central trunk with short lateral branches. These forms of Norway maple are
    good choices for street trees.
    
     
    
    
    
   
   'Crimson King' - A very popular cultivar that many consider to
    be overused. Leaves emerge bright crimson and deepen to maroon which
    persists throughout the growing season. Slower growing than the species.
    Fall color usually a bizarre brownish-maroon. 
   
   
    
    
    
    
    
   
   'Drummondii' - Possesses light green leaves with with a
    prominent white edge. Somewhat slow growing, developing an oval to rounded
    head. Frequently reverts and green sections must be removed or they will
    overgrow variegated sections because of their greater vigor
   
   
 
   
   

   
   
'Emerald Queen' - Increasingly popular for its upright, rounded habit 
  ( to 50' tall and 40' wide) and yellow fall color. Commonly planted.
'Globosum' - A truly dwarf form (15' to 18'). Develops a compact, rounded, 
  dense head. Typically grafted at around 6 feet. An excellent choice for planting 
  beneath utility lines. 

   
   
'Schwedleri' - An old cultivar that is a parent of many of the newer 
  red foliage forms. Grows larger and more rapidly than 'Crimson King'. Foliage 
  emerges maroon, but turns black-green as it matures. Color effect is more subtle 
  than 'Crimson King' and is easier to use in landscapes.
'Summershade' - A handsome shade tree with a rounded mature form (to 
  40' tall and wide) and good foliage substance. Marketed as being fast-growing 
  and resistant to summer heat. Fall color has proved to be inferior to other 
  forms.","Habitat

   'Columnare', 'Erectum', 'Olmsted' - Some confusion exists as to
    the exact characteristics of these 3 cultivars. All are upright, columnar
    forms 10' to 20' wide and 40' to 60' tall. Generally comprised of a single
    central trunk with short lateral branches. These forms of Norway maple are
    good choices for street trees.
    
     
    
    
    
   
   'Crimson King' - A very popular cultivar that many consider to
    be overused. Leaves emerge bright crimson and deepen to maroon which
    persists throughout the growing season. Slower growing than the species.
    Fall color usually a bizarre brownish-maroon. 
   
   
    
    
    
    
    
   
   'Drummondii' - Possesses light green leaves with with a
    prominent white edge. Somewhat slow growing, developing an oval to rounded
    head. Frequently reverts and green sections must be removed or they will
    overgrow variegated sections because of their greater vigor
   
   
 
   
   

   
   
'Emerald Queen' - Increasingly popular for its upright, rounded habit 
  ( to 50' tall and 40' wide) and yellow fall color. Commonly planted.
'Globosum' - A truly dwarf form (15' to 18'). Develops a compact, rounded, 
  dense head. Typically grafted at around 6 feet. An excellent choice for planting 
  beneath utility lines. 

   
   
'Schwedleri' - An old cultivar that is a parent of many of the newer 
  red foliage forms. Grows larger and more rapidly than 'Crimson King'. Foliage 
  emerges maroon, but turns black-green as it matures. Color effect is more subtle 
  than 'Crimson King' and is easier to use in landscapes.
'Summershade' - A handsome shade tree with a rounded mature form (to 
  40' tall and wide) and good foliage substance. Marketed as being fast-growing 
  and resistant to summer heat. Fall color has proved to be inferior to other 
  forms.","
Habitat

Native to Europe

'Armstrong'- An upright or fastigiate selection that grows to around 
  60' tall and 15' wide. Lacks consistent orange or red fall color. May be an 
  A. rubrum x A. saccharinum hybrid (Acer x freemanii).
'Autumn Flame' - Notable for its pleasant rounded habit as a young tree, 
  growing to 60' tall. Good fall color and smaller leaves than normal. May lack 
  the hardiness of other cultivars.
    
    'Bowhall' - An upright, pyramidal form that is significantly
      wider than 'Armstrong' or 'Columnare'. Fall color is yellow-orange with
      red highlights.
    
    'Columnare' - Similar to 'Armstrong', but slower growing and
      more compact. Has better summer foliage quality and dependable orange-red
      fall color.
    
    
'Franksred' (Red Sunset®) - Pyramidal to rounded form. Striking 
  red fall color. Earlier color development than 'October Glory' and more cold 
  hardy. Grows to 45 to 50' tall. 
'Northwood' (Northwood®) - A cultivar selected for its fine 
  tolerance of harsh winter conditions. The crown is oval and the branches ascend 
  upwards. Fall color may not be as effective as other selections, and some have 
  suggested that the growth form may become irregular with age.
'October Glory' (October Glory®) - Develops good red to burgundy 
  fall color and has dark green summer foliage. Colors late in October. May have 
  limitations as far as cold hardiness and winter twig kill susceptibility. Oval 
  shape, 40' to 50' tall.","Habitat

     Cultivars/Varieties
    
    
'Armstrong'- An upright or fastigiate selection that grows to around 
  60' tall and 15' wide. Lacks consistent orange or red fall color. May be an 
  A. rubrum x A. saccharinum hybrid (Acer x freemanii).
'Autumn Flame' - Notable for its pleasant rounded habit as a young tree, 
  growing to 60' tall. Good fall color and smaller leaves than normal. May lack 
  the hardiness of other cultivars.
    
    'Bowhall' - An upright, pyramidal form that is significantly
      wider than 'Armstrong' or 'Columnare'. Fall color is yellow-orange with
      red highlights.
    
    'Columnare' - Similar to 'Armstrong', but slower growing and
      more compact. Has better summer foliage quality and dependable orange-red
      fall color.
    
    
'Franksred' (Red Sunset®) - Pyramidal to rounded form. Striking 
  red fall color. Earlier color development than 'October Glory' and more cold 
  hardy. Grows to 45 to 50' tall. 
'Northwood' (Northwood®) - A cultivar selected for its fine 
  tolerance of harsh winter conditions. The crown is oval and the branches ascend 
  upwards. Fall color may not be as effective as other selections, and some have 
  suggested that the growth form may become irregular with age.
'October Glory' (October Glory®) - Develops good red to burgundy 
  fall color and has dark green summer foliage. Colors late in October. May have 
  limitations as far as cold hardiness and winter twig kill susceptibility. Oval 
  shape, 40' to 50' tall.","
Habitat

Very large geographic and climatic range 
Eastern United States and adjacent Canada 
Zone 3, but plants must have originated from the northern part of its range 

Habit and Form 
Deciduous 
Pyramidal or elliptical when young 
Becomes more spreading with age, eventually developing a more or less rounded or oval outline 
A medium to large tree, 40' to 70' tall, but can be over 100' tall
Texture is medium 
Relatively fast growing 

Summer Foliage 
Opposite, 2"" to 4"" long, 3 or 5-lobed 
Medium green upper leaf color, gray-green or frosty underside 

Autumn Foliage 
Varies from greenish yellow to vibrant scarlet to burgundy 
Can be very striking; many cultivars selected for red fall foliage 
Often one of the first trees to color 

Flowers
Red or orange, in late March and April, showy 
Monoecious with male and female flowers on separate branches of a tree; some flowers may be perfect as well
Female flowers more showy with redder color 

Fruit
Samaras, 0.75"" long 
Often display some red color and ornamental appeal 

Bark
Attractive and a useful ornamental feature 
Young bark is smooth and light, ash-gray, almost silver 
Older branches and trunk are covered with scaly gray brown bark 
Bark contrasts well with early spring flowers 

Culture
Easy to transplant and establish 
Tolerant of many conditions and adaptable 
Prefers moist, acidic soils 
Tolerates occasional flooding and wet soils 
On alkaline soils develops manganese chlorosis 
Full sun best for landscape development, but can tolerate partial shade 

Landscape Uses 
For shade in lawns, parks, campuses 
Good for fall foliage color and bark 
Good street tree 

Liabilities
Can be somewhat weak wooded and may suffer storm damage 
Because the species is so genetically diverse careful attention is needed to insure adequate cold hardiness and the desired red fall foliage 
Manganese chlorosis 
Tar spot, verticillium wilt leaf hoppers 

ID Features
Ashy-gray bark 
Clusters of ""Christmas ornament"" flower buds along with smaller vegetative buds 
Twigs produce an odor when broken 
Confused with Acer saccharinum. In leaf, leaf shapes separate species. Out of leaf A. rubrum doesn't have ""droop and swoop"" branch tips like A. saccharinum 
Old bark not as shaggy or silvery as A. saccharinum 

Propagation
By seed 
No longer grafted due to incompatibilities 
Cultivars are by stem cuttings or tissue culture

A large deciduous tree, typically 60' to 80' tall, but can be over 100' tall. Upright-oval to spreading crown. Several open-grown specimens I have seen had a rounded or mushroom-shaped top. Texture is medium to coarse.

Summer Foliage

Opposite, palmately compound, with 5 leaflets. Each leaflet is 4"" to 6"" long and elliptical. Excellent dark green foliage that is glabrous when mature. Less troubled by foliar diseases and problems than other buckeyes.

Autumn Foliage

Has better color than other Aesculus. Can be a nice yellow or pale orange.

Flowers

Blooms in May, yellow or yellow green. Panicles are 6"" tall and 2"" to 3"" wide.

Fruit

2"" to 2.5"" capsule containing 2 seeds. Fruit is smooth, pear-shaped, leathery and tan.

Bark

Interesting gray and brown. Old trunks exhibit bark with large flat scales and plates.

Culture

Prefers a deep, moist, well-drained soil. Avoid excessively hot, dry locations which can induce leaf scorch problems. Full sun for good development. Transplant B&B or from container only; has a fleshy, sparsely-branched root system.

Landscape Use

Needs room to develop. For large lawns on estates and campus, and in public spaces and parks. Definitely the nicest of the large Aesculus sp. Excellent choice for shade and variety in the landscape. Plus it also has flowers.

Liabilities

May be difficult to locate in the trade, uncommon and somewhat difficult for nurseries to mass produce quickly. Leaf scorch and leaf blotch. Fruit litter can be messy. Numerous insects and diseases can be a problem, but A. flava is the least bothered of all the species. Have observed many beautiful specimens over the years.

Can be difficult to transplant and establish. Probably prefers a well-drained, sandy soil. Acidic soils may be best. Full sun to very light shade. Do not fertilize. Does not need pruning.

Landscape Use

Salt tolerant, so good seaside groundcover. Is effective plant along a rock wall where it can cascade over the edge. Useful on sandy slopes and banks.

Liabilities

Hard to establish. Can develop winter burn from sun and wind when cold. Does not like excessive summer heat. Can develop foliar diseases when stressed (leaf spot).

ID Features

Evergreen groundcover. Small, dark green, alternate leaves. Small white urn-shaped flowers in spring, red fruit in late summer. Papery exfoliating bark with purple-red base color. Thin, sprawling stems.

Propagation

By stem cuttings. Seed require scarification and stratification.

Cultivars/Varieties

'Massachusetts' - A disease resistant selection with smaller leaves than the species. Tends to flower and fruit well. Raised on the west coast of U.S. from Massachusetts seed. Very common in the trade.
'Point Reyes' - Features good, deep-green foliage color and leaves closely-spaced on the stems. Supposedly more heat and drought tolerant than other forms.
'Vancouver Jade' - A University of British Columbia Botanical Garden introduction. Has larger, glossier leaves than typical. Foliage develops a nice wine color in the fall. A more vigorous grower than most A. uva-ursi."

Cultivars/Varieties 

The variegated cultivars of Aralia elata are among the most spectacular variegated 
  plants, but they must be grafted and are therefore rare and expensive.
'Aureovariegata' - This form bears yellow-edged leaflets and is the 
  most common cultivar.

'Golden Umbrella' - A new, rare form featuring refined yellow-margined 
  leaflets that fade to white, this plant is not common.
'Silver Umbrellas' - This plant is similar to 'Variegata', but is smaller 
  in all respects and more finely textured. 

'Variegata' - Most notable for its white-edged leaflets, this plant

'Dalecarlica' and 'Laciniata' - Both have deeply cut and pendulous 
  leaves, pendulous branches and an overall upright growth form. 'Dalecarlica'

  leaves are less deeply cut than 'Dalecarlica' leaves.

purpurea - Leaves are deeply reddish-purple in spring, but the 
  color ""greens up"" as the season progresses. Most purple-leaved B. 
  pendula seems to be less vigorous than the green-leaved forms and are very 
  susceptible to bronze birch borer.

  forms are best used as specimens, as the early purple leaves and white bark 
  can be a striking contrast.
    
    
'Youngii' and 'Tristis' - Both are weeping forms with normal leaves. 
'Youngii' lacks a central leader and has very pendulous branches. Generally develops 
an irregular horizontal and then arching crown (mushroom-shaped). 'Tristis' tends

Habitat

The most widely distributed (east to west) of all North American birches is northern North America, Labrador to Alaska, south into Northern Rocky Mountains, northern plains states and Pennsylvania. It is hardy to zone 2.

Habit and Form

A deciduous, medium-sized tree, it grows 50' to 70' tall and is more or less pyramidal when young. Older trees become oval to rounded, with increasing irregularity in shape. Individuals have single trunks, but nurseries often grow them in groups of 3 or 4 (""clump birches"") individual seedlings planted together in a common container. It is fast growing, especially when young, and typically branched to a few feet above the ground in open exposures. The texture is medium.

Summer Foliage

Alternate, ovate, simple leaves, 2"" to 4"" long and 1.5"" to 3"" wide, often with an acuminate or pointed tip, and leaf base either acute or heart-shaped. The color is a dull, dark green above and paler on the underside.

Autumn Foliage

Clear bright yellow, typically dependable and showy.

Flowers

2"" to 4"" long catkins, usually in 3's and some in pairs (male). Female catkins 1"" to 1.5"" long, blooming in early spring prior to bloom, catkins are shorter. Little ornamental value.

Fruit

Catkins, 1"" to 1.5"" long, composed of nutlets. No ornamental importance.

Bark

Young branches show smooth, reddish-brown bark with horizontal lenticels. Bark becoming papery, chalky white after about 4 seasons. Bark exfoliates or peels in strips to expose orange inner bark. On very mature trunks, the white is mixed with rough, black patches. Probably the best white bark birch. The bark remains white longer than B. pendula and turns white relatively quickly on young branches.

Culture

Best adapted to cooler climates, it does poorly in high summer heat, especially root zone heat. Fairly soil adaptable, often found growing in sandy, gravely soils. Prefers well-drained, slightly acid sandy loam soils. Easy to transplant and establish from container or B&B. Not tolerant of pollution or difficult sites. Full sun. Avoid spring pruning to prevent bleeding.

Landscape Use

For decoration from showy bark on fall color, as a lawn tree or specimen, in parks, on campuses, generally not for inner city. Effective in small groupings. Shade seems to be light enough to allow turf to survive underneath.

Liabilities

Bronze birch borer can be a serious problem and often hits trees just as they enter their peak in the landscape. Not as bad as B. pendula. Can get leaf miner, but not as badly as B. populifolia. Not tolerant of harsh conditions or heat. Bark can be slow to turn white for the impatient. Vandalism of the bark by carving of ones initials, leaving black scars.

ID Features

White bark that is chalky and exfoliates (compare to (B. pendula whose bark does not exfoliate). Catkins in 2's or 3's and fatter than other 3-catkin species like B. nigra and B. pendula.

Propagation

By seed. Cuttings can be tricky to root and overwinter.

    Cultivars/Varieties
    
    
'Cully' (Heritage®) - This cultivar has become the dominant birch 
  cultivar in the marketplace. It is superior in terms of disease resistance, 
  as it is not plaqued as heavily by leaf spot or borers. Ornamentally, the peeling 
  bark is very striking at a young age, exfoliating to reveal salmon-brown and 
  white patches. Fall color can be a good yellow, and the habit is usually multi-stemmed 
  and rounded to 50' tall.
    
    
'Little King' (Fox Valley™) - A form that is gaining more 
  exposure and popularity in recent years. It is a relatively dwarf plant not 
  expected to exceed 15' tall, with very dense growth and branches to the ground. 
  The habit is rounded and the bark exfoliates like the species for a good winter 
  display. It might be employed as a specimen or as a hedge/mass in areas with 
  moist soil.","Habitat

Native to eastern North America; also found in cooler areas in the mountains of Georgia and the Southwest. 
Zone 3.

Habit and Form

Medium shade tree. 
Deciduous. 
Pyramidal and dense when young, developing a broad, round, spreading crown when mature. 
40' to 55' in the landscape; 70' to 80' tall in the wild. 
Medium texture.

Summer Foliage

Alternate, simple leaves, 2.5"" to 6"" long by 1-1.5"" to 3-3.5"" wide. 
Broad, ovate leaves with cordate base. 
Shiny green above, paler below.

Autumn Foliage

Reliable, uniform golden yellow color. 
One of the best of the commonly grown birches.

Flowers

Blooms in April. 
Monoecious: male catkins 2"" to 3"" long in bloom, in groups of 4 (3-8); female catkins 1"".

Fruit

Tiny winged nutlets (nearly 1 million per pound).

Bark

Young bark reddish-brown to black, with large horizontal lenticels; older bark black, plate-like.

Culture

Best on deep, rich, moist, acidic soils, but can also be found on rocky, drier sites and heavy soil. 
Resistant to bronze birch borer. 
Best in full sun; tolerates light shade.

Landscape Use

Shade tree for parks, naturalized areas, other large sites.

Liabilities

Canker; can have a number of other insect and disease problems common to birch, most not problematic. 
Not a white-barked birch.

ID Features

Bruised twigs have wintergreen odor; but taste sweet (B. alleghaniensis tastes bitter). 
Slender catkins, usually in 4's (B. alleghaniensis catkins are larger and usually in groups of 5 or more). 
Bark reddish-brown when young (B. alleghaniensis has yellow-brown bark). 
Older bark black, not exfoliating like B. alleghaniensis. 
Twigs glabrous (B. alleghaniensis slightly pubescent).

Propagation

By seed.

    Cultivars/Varieties
    
    There are numerous cultivars available on the market today. Listed below
      are some of the better or more common ones representing the range of forms
      available. Many of the newer cultivars have trademark names.
    
    
var. atropurpurea - A naturally-occuring variety that has reddish 
  foliage that tends to fade to green during the summer. Comes true from seed 
  with a range of intensity in the red color. Commercial red foliage cultivars 
  are chiefly selections of this variety with exceptionally nice coloration or 
  habit.
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
'Aurea' - Has striking yellow foliage. Will turn yellow-green in shade. 
  Foliage does not burn in full sun and hot conditions. Slow-growing, eventually 
  reaching 3' to 5' tall, with equal spread. Does not flower or fruit heavily.
    
    
'Bagatelle' - A compact form that is similar to 'Crimson Pygmy', except 
  the leaves are shinier and smaller, and the plant grows more slowly. To about 
  12"" to 16"" tall. Foliage is a strong purple-red.
    
    
'Bogozam' (Bananza Gold™) - A dwarf, golden pygmy barberry with 
  a dense mounding habit. Grows 1.5' to 2' tall and 2' to 2.5' wide. Bright gold 
  foliage does not scald in sun.
    
    
    
    
'Crimson Pygmy' - A slow-growing, red leaf form with a mounding, dense 
  habit. One of the older dwarf, red foliage cultivars. Red color is best in full 
  sun. 1' to 2' tall and 2' to 3' wide under most circumstances, but can be larger. 
  Probably the best known barberry cultivar.
    
    
      
    
    
    
'Kobold' - A compact form to 2' to 2.5' tall, with a mounded habit. 
  Foliage matures to a dark , shiny green. Little flower or fruit display.
'Helmond Pillar' - A striking, unique form just now receiving attention 
  in the trade. A strictly upright, fastigiate form growing to 8' tall but only 
  1'-2' wide. Forms a slow-growing column of red leaves.
    
    
'Rose Glow' (also labeled as 'Rosy Glow' and 'Rosey Glow') 
  - A vigorous grower with red and cream variegated foliage. The mixing in of 
  cream on the foliage is most pronounced on vigorously growing shoots, as older 
  growth seems to fade to solid red. Best color development is achieved in full 
  sun. Introduced from Denmark and very common on the market.
    
    
      
    
    
    
'Sparkle' - An improved green barberry with a compact habit, 3' to 4' 
  tall and slightly wider. Foliage is dark green, leathery and heavy in substance. 
  Fall color is fluorescent orange-red. Produces copious flowers and fruit.
'Thornless' (may also be called 'Inermis') - Notable for the 
  stems, which are essentially thornless. The habit is also more rounded and compact, 
  to 5' tall and wide. Fall color is orange/red.
    
    'Variegata' - Leaves are mostly green with streaks and splotches
      of white.","Habitat

  Fast growing to 6' by 6'. Foliage will bronze and yellow some in the winter.
    
    
'Winter Beauty' - A mounded form with dark green foliage. Requires little 
  pruning. Will bronze in the winter, but its version of bonzing is considered 
  to be attractive. A var. koreana selection.
    
    
'Winter Gem' - A var. koreana selection, growing to 4' tall and 
  wide. Very similar to 'Winter Beauty' and may be a renamed cultivar.
'Wintergreen' - Has bright green leaf color and small leaves. Has performed 
  well in cold climates. Leaves do not discolor in the winter. 2'-3' tall.

Cultivars/Varieties

'Athens' - Unusual form with flowers that are yellow and very fragrant. Flowers may be produced after initial late spring flush, often into mid-summer. Habit is dense and mounded (to 6' tall), with glossy leaves. A handsome form that has been well-received by horticulturists.

'Edith Wilder' - Flowers are reddish-brown and very fragrant. Leaves are more rounded than typical. Fall color is a reasonably good yellow. Grows larger (10' tall) than typical for the species.

'Michael Lindsey' - Very fragrant red-brown flowers. Habit is dense, compact and rounded (6' to 10' tall). Excellent shiny, dark green foliage and golden yellow fall color. Considered the finest red-flowered form."

While the flowering habit is unusual and the plant is very hardy, some reports indictate that it may be more prone to fireblight disease."

    Cultivars/Varieties
    
    
'Aurea' - A relatively weak grower with bright yellow foliage in the 
  spring which turns dull green by mid-summer. The branches are also yellowish. 

    
    
'Contorta' - The most popular C. avellana grown in the United 
  States and often the only form available from nurseries. Known as Harry Lauder's 
  Walking Stick, it has curled, twisted and contorted branches. Popular specimen 
  and accent plant. Reaches heights of 6' to 8' with similar or greater spread. 
  It is often grafted and suckers badly from the rootstock -- buy own-root plants 
  if possible. The plant produces catkins in winter, but no fruit. 'Contorta' 
  may actually be at its best in winter, when the contorted branches are easily 
  viewed without the presence of foliage.
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
'Fusco-rubra' - Leaves are brownish-red to dull purple. Not very commonly 
  available, but a large vigorous plant to 15' tall. 'Rote Zeller' is another 
  purple-leaved C. avellana seen in the literature, but C. maxima 
  'Purpurea' (also seen as C. m. var. purpurea) is by far the most 
  commonly available purple-leaved filbert.

'Cardinal' - A common form popular for its good bright red stems in 
  winter, though the color may be yellowish in warmer zones. Fairly disease resistant, 
  the plant grows to 10' tall and wide. Renewal pruning in early spring promotes 
  best stem color.

  leaves, red-brown stems and bluish fruit.
    
    
'Flaviramea' - A highly popular form with stems that turn bright yellow

  'Bud's Yellow' may be preferable. An effective plant for bright winter color, 
  but the plant can be garish in mass.

Cultivars/Varieties 

var. chinensis - This form supposedly flowers more freely and 
  produces larger flower bracts, with leaves that are also said to be larger than 
  average. The validity of this variety, however, is questioned by some authorities.
    
    
'Beni Fuji' - This form bears the deepest red-pink bracts of any C. 
  kousa cultivar, even stronger than 'Satomi'. The color may not be as strong 
  in warm summer areas.
'Elizabeth Lustgarten' and 'Lustgarten Weeping' - Notable for 
  their weeping habits, this duo of cultivars grow to 15' with branches that arch 
  downwards and bear white blooms. The habit is rounded and gentle, thus a mature 
  specimen is attractive.
'Gold Star' - The center of each leaf has a broad gold band on this 
  cultivar, with stems that are somewhat reddish. It is relatively slow-growing, 
  but in time does form a small-medium rounded tree. The flower bracts are white, 
  and the contrast between the red fruit and gold-splashed foliage can be striking.

'Little Beauty' - This plant forms a small, densely branched tree that 
  may never exceed 15' tall. Other traits are as per the species.
'Milky Way' - One of the most common cultivars in the trade, this selection 
  of var. chinensis is, however, probably composed of over a dozen similar 
  clones. The plant is extremely floriferous and sets a very heavy crop of fruit. 
  When in bloom, the pure white bracts can conceal the foliage.
    
    
'Satomi' (also listed as 'Rosabella') - This is a very 
  popular cultivar said to develop bright pink bracts. In the United States, however, 
  the warm summers seem to dull the color. As a result, most plants bloom light 
  pink or white-pink. The color can vary from season to season, but 'Beni Fuji' 
  probably has deeper pink bracts.
    
    
      
    
    
'Snowboy' - This form sports gray-green leaves that are edged in white, 
  with occasional splashes of variegation throughout the foliage. While the plant 
  is attractive when well grown, it is very slow-growing and is best sited in 
  a shady location to avoid leaf scorch.
'Summer Stars' - The flower bracts on this selection are not as large as 
those of other cultivars, but they are retained longer. Blooms heavily and grows 
to 25' tall with a vase shape. 
'Temple Jewel' - This is an interesting variegated form with leaves 
  that show a light marbling of green, gold and light pink that turns mostly green 
  with age. It grows well to 20' tall and wider with a dense habit. The bracts 
  are white.
'Variegata' - Various clones exist with differing degrees of yellow 
  or white variegation. The pattern may be unstable, plus the plants can produce 
  green growth reversions. Most are slower growing and benefit from siting in 
  some shade.

'Wolf Eyes' - This is a very popular variegated form with leaves that 
  show a uniform white margin. The leaf margins are often prominently wavy, as 
  well. The variegation pattern is quite stable and resistant to burning, though 
  a shaded planting site is still desirable. In fall, the leaves develop attractive 
  pink to red coloration. The plant is shrubby and slow-growing, to 10' tall and 
  wide.","Habitat

Cultivars/Varieties 

var. chinensis - This form supposedly flowers more freely and 
  produces larger flower bracts, with leaves that are also said to be larger than 
  average. The validity of this variety, however, is questioned by some authorities.
    
    
'Beni Fuji' - This form bears the deepest red-pink bracts of any C. 
  kousa cultivar, even stronger than 'Satomi'. The color may not be as strong 
  in warm summer areas.
'Elizabeth Lustgarten' and 'Lustgarten Weeping' - Notable for 
  their weeping habits, this duo of cultivars grow to 15' with branches that arch 
  downwards and bear white blooms. The habit is rounded and gentle, thus a mature 
  specimen is attractive.
'Gold Star' - The center of each leaf has a broad gold band on this 
  cultivar, with stems that are somewhat reddish. It is relatively slow-growing, 
  but in time does form a small-medium rounded tree. The flower bracts are white, 
  and the contrast between the red fruit and gold-splashed foliage can be striking.

'Little Beauty' - This plant forms a small, densely branched tree that 
  may never exceed 15' tall. Other traits are as per the species.
'Milky Way' - One of the most common cultivars in the trade, this selection 
  of var. chinensis is, however, probably composed of over a dozen similar 
  clones. The plant is extremely floriferous and sets a very heavy crop of fruit. 
  When in bloom, the pure white bracts can conceal the foliage.
    
    
'Satomi' (also listed as 'Rosabella') - This is a very

Cultivars/Varieties

Dwarf forms (such as 'Compacta') and fastigiate plants (such as 'Fastigiata') are known, but they are rarely available and perhaps best reserved for collectors.
'Cherokee Brave' - Considered one of the best red forms, with deep pink bracts that have a white center. Will grow 15' tall.
'Cherokee Chief' - A popular selection with bracts that are deep red and reddish new growth. The most popular red-pink dogwood.
'Cherokee Daybreak' ('Cherokee Daybreak™) - A variegated selection with white-margined leaves that age to pink in fall. Flower bracts are white.
'Cherokee Princess' - This form blooms at an early age, with very large white flowers -- up to 5"" across. It blooms heavily and reliably every year. It's always ranked near the top of dogwood evaluations.
'Cherokee Sunset' (Cherokee Sunset™) - A red-flowered form with variegated foliage that is marked with pink/yellow. A good performer, with strong growth to 25' tall and disease resistance.
'Cloud 9' - A slow-growing cultivar with white overlapping bracts. Very heavy bloomer that starts producing as a young plant. Shows good cold hardiness.
'Pendula' - This rare form features branches that are strongly weeping. Flower bracts are white.
'Plena' - Somewhat of a catch-all name for double, white-bracted forms.
var rubra ('Rubra') - This variety has flowers that range from pink to reddish with considerable variation in color. Very common in the trade.
'Welchii' - The leaves are variegated with a mixture of green, cream and pink. Flowers are white and the fall color is rose red. It benefits from a location in partial shade.
'Xanthocarpa' - A form with unusual yellow fruits and white-bracted flowers."

'Alleman's Compact' - A hardy, disease-free compact dwarf form growing 
  to 6' tall with red stems in winter.
'Argenteo-marginata' (also seen often as 'Elegantissima') - Leaves 
  are narrower than the species and edged with white. A less vigorous grower than 
  the species (to 6' tall), with red winter stems. A common plant at nurseries.
    
    
 
   
  
'Bailhalo' (Ivory Halo™) - A useful, fairly common introduction 
  with leaf and stem habit similar to 'Argenteo-marginata', but more compact form 
  and dense branching (to 5' tall and wide).

'Bloodgood' - Selected for its very showy red stems.
'Bud's Yellow' - Commonly seen in current catalogs, this form features 
  bright yellow stems. Growing to 6' tall and wider, it may represent a good substitute 
  for the disease-prone C. sericea 'Flaviramea'.
'Gouchaultii' - An interesting variegate, often confused with 'Spaethii', 
  that features red stems and leaves margined yellow and pink, often fading to 
  white on the margins. It's fairly vigorous, often reaching 6' tall and wider.
'Siberian Pearls' - A form selected for profuse white flowers and good 
  fruit set with white/blue drupes. The stem color is red.
'Sibirica' (perhaps confused with 'Westonbirt') - Stems are coral-red 
  and fruits are bluish. Also, the leaves are more rounded than the species. Probably 
  not as vigorous as the species (to 6' tall). Plants in the trade labelled 'Siberica' 
  seem to be variable and undoubtedly represent more than one genotype.
    
    
    
    
'Spaethii' - Leaves have a strong border of yellow around them, and 
  they usually do not scorch in summer heat. Less vigorous than the species (to 
  5' tall).","Habitat

'Alleman's Compact' - A hardy, disease-free compact dwarf form growing 
  to 6' tall with red stems in winter.
'Argenteo-marginata' (also seen often as 'Elegantissima') - Leaves 
  are narrower than the species and edged with white. A less vigorous grower than 
  the species (to 6' tall), with red winter stems. A common plant at nurseries.
    
    
 
   
  
'Bailhalo' (Ivory Halo™) - A useful, fairly common introduction 
  with leaf and stem habit similar to 'Argenteo-marginata', but more compact form 
  and dense branching (to 5' tall and wide).

'Bloodgood' - Selected for its very showy red stems.
'Bud's Yellow' - Commonly seen in current catalogs, this form features 
  bright yellow stems. Growing to 6' tall and wider, it may represent a good substitute 
  for the disease-prone C. sericea 'Flaviramea'.
'Gouchaultii' - An interesting variegate, often confused with 'Spaethii', 
  that features red stems and leaves margined yellow and pink, often fading to 
  white on the margins. It's fairly vigorous, often reaching 6' tall and wider.
'Siberian Pearls' - A form selected for profuse white flowers and good 
  fruit set with white/blue drupes. The stem color is red.
'Sibirica' (perhaps confused with 'Westonbirt') - Stems are coral-red 
  and fruits are bluish. Also, the leaves are more rounded than the species. Probably 
  not as vigorous as the species (to 6' tall). Plants in the trade labelled 'Siberica' 
  seem to be variable and undoubtedly represent more than one genotype.
    
    
    
    
'Spaethii' - Leaves have a strong border of yellow around them, and 
  they usually do not scorch in summer heat. Less vigorous than the species (to 
  5' tall).","
Habitat

Native to Siberia, Manchuria, N. Korea
Cold hardy to zone 2

Habit and Form

A suckering, colonizing deciduous shrub
4' to 8' tall and just about as wide
Branching is upright and spreading
Most stems branch little, except near the tip
Shape is rounded

Summer Foliage

Opposite simple leaves
Leaf shape is ovate to elliptic
Laves are 2"" to 4.5"" long and 1"" to 2"" wide
Leaf tips are acute to acuminate
Leaves emerge yellow-green and mature to medium or dark green 

Autumn Foliage

Often a showy red
Some plants fail to develop good fall color

Flowers

Small, yellowish white flowers are held in flattened clusters
Flower clusters are 1.5"" to 2"" in diameter
Bloom time is late May to early June

Fruit

Fruits are white or tinged blue
Each fruit is about 0.4"" in diameter
Fruits ripen in July

Bark

In winter, stems turn a vivid blood red color
In spring, stem color reverts to nearly green
Stems are smooth, except for lenticels
Very showy 

Culture

Tolerant of poorly-drained soils
Easily transplanted and established
Full sun or partial shade
Remove oldest stems each year to promote suckering, since new stems have the best stem color

Landscape Use

Border
Mass plantings
Wet soil sites
Naturalistic areas
For winter ornamental appeal
Probably not at its best used individually

Liabilities

Leaf spot
Twig blight and canker
Borers 
Scale

ID Features

Colonizing sucking shrub
Red twig color in winter
Stems branch little, except at the tips
Conspicuous lenticels on the stems

'Anne Bidwell' - Produces flowers that are larger than the species, 
  also perhaps later. More compact, to 6' tall.
'Creels Calico' - The foliage of this selection is marked with variable 
  creamy white variegation. The flowers are white, and the plant will probably 
  mature at 4' tall. It's a rather interesting form.

    
    
'Hummingbird' - Perhaps the most popular commercial selection. Selected 
  by Callaway Gardens for its compact growth, heavy flowering and shiny foliage. 
  The plant matures at 3'-4' tall and has good fall color. Reports indicate good 
  performance across a wide geographical range.

    
    
'Paniculata' - Purported to have large panicles of flowers, but the 
  plant may be misnamed and not reliable in this floral performance.
    
    
'Pink Spires' - Buds are rose-colored and open to light pink. Flowers 
  do not fade, and the plant grows to 8' tall.
    
    
      
    
    
'Rosea' - Pink flower buds open pink, but then fade to nearly white. 
  An older cultivar.
    
    
'Ruby Spice' - The darkest pink selection. Red buds open to pink and 
  do not fade. Dark green, glossy foliage. Selected by Andy Brand at Broken Arrow 
  Nursery in Hamden, CT. This award-winning plant has been embraced by the nursery 
  industry and is very common.
    
    

'September Beauty' - A new form that is reported to flower up to two 
  weeks later than the species. Growth is more compact and the foliage is a good 
  green.","Habitat

'Anne Bidwell' - Produces flowers that are larger than the species, 
  also perhaps later. More compact, to 6' tall.
'Creels Calico' - The foliage of this selection is marked with variable 
  creamy white variegation. The flowers are white, and the plant will probably 
  mature at 4' tall. It's a rather interesting form.

    
    
'Hummingbird' - Perhaps the most popular commercial selection. Selected 
  by Callaway Gardens for its compact growth, heavy flowering and shiny foliage. 
  The plant matures at 3'-4' tall and has good fall color. Reports indicate good 
  performance across a wide geographical range.

    
    
'Paniculata' - Purported to have large panicles of flowers, but the 
  plant may be misnamed and not reliable in this floral performance.

  do not fade, and the plant grows to 8' tall.
    
    
      
    
    
'Rosea' - Pink flower buds open pink, but then fade to nearly white. 
  An older cultivar.
    
    
'Ruby Spice' - The darkest pink selection. Red buds open to pink and

'Winter King' - A form that has burst onto the market in recent years, 
  won many awards and been embraced by observers. The fall/winter fruit show can 
  be spectacular, with red pomes that are profuse and persist late into the season. 
  The habit is rounded, to 20' tall and wider, and the plant develops good fall

  won many awards and been embraced by observers. The fall/winter fruit show can 
  be spectacular, with red pomes that are profuse and persist late into the season. 
  The habit is rounded, to 20' tall and wider, and the plant develops good fall 
  color. White spring flowers and distinct gray bark are added assets. This plant 
  is probably the most commonly available hawthorn on the market.","

Cultivars/Varieties 

'Perpusillus' - One of the lowest, most prostrate selections. This plant 
  only grows to 1' tall and up to 7' wide. The glossy deep green leaves are alleged 
  to be susceptible to fireblight.
'Tom Thumb' (also listed as 'Little Gem') - Has a compact, dense, 
  closely-branched habit that develops into a broad-spreading mound with dark 
  green leaves. Makes a good rock garden specimen. Some authorities place this 
  cultivar under Cotoneaster adpressus.
    
    

'Variegatus' - A widely available, slow-growing form with tiny leaves 
  margined with white. Grows slowly to 3' tall and 6' wide with layered branches. 
  Interesting in that it has some of the smallest variegated leaves of any plant.","Habitat
